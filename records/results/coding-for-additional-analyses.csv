This alone is problematic, as estimating the size of a minority population by respondents is rarely accurate and accuracy varies depending upon many variables (Nadeau et al. 1993). Even  when the researcher can get away from these estimating problems, there remains  an implied assumption that individuals who operate within integrated settings will actually have interpersonal contact with members of the out-group. The present study relieves us of these vexing assumptions by utilizing a much more direct indicator of interracial contact. These five questions, which constitute the second  independent variable, examine the level of casual contact individuals have with  members of the out-group while going about their life’s activities in the public arena. All respondents were asked how often they have conversations with members of the other race while on the job, shopping, at events with their children, at church and at entertainment venues.

Most studies in the past have used indirect indicators of casual contact, such as asking respondents for the racial composition of their neighborhood or even that of the local school. To make  this type of data useful, the respondent must possess an accurate estimate of the racial composition of his or her surroundings. This alone is problematic, as estimating the size of a minority population by respondents is rarely accurate and accuracy varies depending upon many variables (Nadeau et al. 1993). Even  when the researcher can get away from these estimating problems, there remains  an implied assumption that individuals who operate within integrated settings will actually have interpersonal contact with members of the out-group. The present study relieves us of these vexing assumptions by utilizing a much more direct indicator of interracial contact. These five questions, which constitute the second  independent variable, examine the level of casual contact individuals have with  members of the out-group while going about their life’s activities in the public arena. All respondents were asked how often they have conversations with members of the other race while on the job, shopping, at events with their children, at church and at entertainment venues. All five questions were recoded so that those responding that they have interracial conversations frequently = 0 , sometimes = .5, and never = 1.",Contact quantity,White Americans,No

Coder 1,2309,pc,"Participants completed 69 items assessing the frequency and intensity of a wide range of interactions with White Americans (see Hayward et al., 2017). Positive contact examples include pleasant, comfortable, friendly, welcoming, and intimate interactions, and becoming friends with a White American person. Negative examples include uncomfortable, awkward, unfriendly, cold, discriminatory, tense, and abusive interactions, and being threatened or rejected by a White American person. For each form of contact, participants were asked whether they had experienced this kind of interaction with Whites at least once before (0 = no, 1 = yes). If the participant responded yes, two follow-up questions assessed (a) how frequently they had experienced this kind of interaction with Whites in the past (1 = extremely rarely, 7 = extremely frequently), and (b) how intensely positive or negative, on average, they found these kinds of interactions with Whites to be (for all 37 positive contact items: 1 = not at all positive, 7 = extremely positive; for all 32 negative items: 1 = not at all negative, 7 = extremely negative). Mean frequency and mean intensity scores were created for each participant, based only on those types of interactions that they reported experiencing at least once. This procedure helps to account for the fact that some people may experience only a few types of interactions but experience them very frequently.  Mean scores were calculated separately for the positive and negative contact items; participants who reported experiencing no contact at all were given a mean frequency score of 0 (to indicate never). Combined frequency x intensity scoreswere then created as per Voci and Hewstone (2003), such that the range of participants’ positive contact scores and negative contact scores ranged from 0 to 49. The full contact measure and further information about how the scales were created are provided in Appendix S1. The vast majority of positive contact items were rated as highly positive (with mean positivity scores above 6 on a 7-point scale), with an overall mean of 6.04.

The questions were: 1) How many of your close neighbours are of a different religion to you / are from the other community? 2) In the area where you live, how many of the people do you think are of a different religion to you? / from the other community? 3) How often do you see members of the other community in this area? In addition, respondents were asked to guess the percentage of Protestants and Catholics living in their local area. This was measured on a continuous scale (range 0- 100%). Responses were then categorised as 0-25%, 26-50%, 51-75%, and 76-100%. Following confirmatory factor analysis using LISREL 8.7, all four items were treated as ordinal and summated to form a quasi-interval perceived ethnic density score where a high score indicated a high level of in-group density.",Opportunity for contact,Protestants,No
