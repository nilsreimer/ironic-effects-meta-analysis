2019-12-06,94,excluded,NA,"Found that the relevant predictor (proportion of students of immigrant background) is included in all analyses on the classroom level (n = 88) rather than on the individual level (n = 1,213). As such, the corresponding correlation (r = .55) is not comparable to other individual-level correlations in our meta-analysis."
