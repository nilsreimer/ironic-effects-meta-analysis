Adolescent feelings of interpersonal humiliation, family conflict and commitment, and friendships with peers were investigated as potential mediators linking acculturation stress to subsequent adolescent self-esteem and internalizing symptoms. Path analyses on data from a sample of 288 Latino adolescents (average age 15 years; 66% foreign-born) showed that acculturation conflicts and perceived discrimination were risk factors for both internalizing problems at baseline and parent-adolescent conflict 6 months later. Baseline internalizing problems, and Time 2 variables (humiliation, parent-adolescent conflict, negative peer relationships, and changes in familism) mediated the effects of acculturation stress on Time 3 (T3) internalizing symptoms and self-esteem. Latino cultural involvement was a key cultural asset, impacting T3 internalizing. symptoms and self-esteem by decreasing feelings of humiliation and by promoting familism. Familism was also a critical cultural asset associated with lower parent-adolescent conflict and higher self-esteem.

Previous studies have highlighted how interculturality facilitates the adaptation of migrants in the host country. This study explores (i) how face-to-face (FTF) and mediated contact and perceived discrimination predict stereotyping, and (ii) how contact, perceived discrimination and stereotyping predict interculturality. A web-based survey was conducted among university students from the People’s Republic of China (n = 585) in Singapore. FTF contact reduced stereotyping better than mediated contact. Perceived discrimination increased stereotyping of the host society by migrants, whereas stereotyping negatively affected interculturality.

Controlling for socio-demographic variables, members of some ethnic minority groups endorsed weak assimilation to a greater extent than the majority. Within members of the majority, the French-speaking Belgians held similar attitudes towards assimilation to the Dutch-speaking Belgians. Among ethnic minorities, the identification of pupils from some foreign-origin countries with the mainstream society was positively associated with the endorsement of strong assimilation, while their ethnic identification remained non-significant. Intergroup friendship among pupils of foreign origin was positively related to strong assimilation. Moreover, pupils of foreign origin who experienced institutional discrimination against ethnic minorities in favour of the majority endorsed strong assimilationism to a lesser extent. Among the majority, the perception that people of foreign origin are victims of discrimination was positively related to the endorsement of weak assimilation. However, this association was mediated by the experience by the majority of institutional discrimination against the majority and in favour of ethnic minorities. In-group identification among the majority was not associated with the endorsement of assimilation.

Fishbein and Ajzen's theory of attitudes was used to test the relationship between beliefs about attributes associated with AAPs and the evaluations of those attributes and AAP attitude. Both qualitative and quantitative research were conducted, including 675 field and student respondents in the quantitative study. Multiple regression was used to analyze the data. As hypothesized, a multiplicative relationship was found between the beliefs and evaluations of attributes associated with AAPs; however, the belief composite did not mediate the effects of race and sex on attitude. As hypothesized, there were significant differences in the belief composite for males and females, and across racial groups. There were no differences in the belief composite and attitude of the student and field respondents. Information frame was manipulated for positive, neutral, and negative conditions, with significant effects for frame on White respondents. Twenty-seven percent (184) of respondents mailed in postcards voting their position on AAPs to Congressional representatives. Over-sampling was conducted to allow for analysis of minority group members' AAP attitudes, including Asian-Americans. Attitudes of Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and Whites, respectively, were most-to-least favorable. Strong and consistent race differences were observed throughout the data. This study contributes to the literature on attitudes toward AAPs by testing the Fishbein and Ajzen theory of attitudes, identifying beliefs and evaluations of attributes associated with AAPs across different racial/ethnic groups. It was demonstrated that AAP attitudes may be changed through presentation of information, however, they are not easily manipulated, nor completely captured by high-level, abstract beliefs and evaluations of attributes associated with AAPs.","management , minority & ethnic groups , sociology",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Method: Our sample comprised 1,975 6th graders (Mage = 11.53, SDage = 0.69, 47% female) in Germany, of whom 1,213 (61%) were of immigrant background, defined as having at least 1 parent born in a different country. A total of 83 countries of origin were represented. We applied a multilevel framework to assess the impact of individual-level and class-level predictors on intergroup outcomes, controlling for the classroom ethnic composition, school track, and individual-level covariates. Immigrant background was treated as a moderator. Results: The 2 types of cultural diversity norms were generally associated with more positive intergroup outcomes. Some of the associations differed in strength between students of immigrant and nonimmigrant background. There were stronger associations of equality/inclusion with higher outgroup orientation among students of nonimmigrant background and with lower perceived discrimination among students of immigrant background. Ethnic composition, as well as the classroom-aggregated diversity norms (diversity climate) showed weaker relations with the outcome variables. Conclusions: Equality/inclusion norms and cultural pluralism norms can make complementary contributions to positive relations between students of immigrant and nonimmigrant background. Equality/inclusion norms foster positive contact and equal treatment, while cultural pluralism norms emphasize that it is also important to value diversity.1 (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",equality; cultural diversity; multiethnic classrooms; intergroup relations; cultural pluralism,Journal Article,NA,PsycInfo

What pattern of interrelationships emerges after the initial stage of contact? What are the conditions which promote ethnic assimilation and integration as opposed to those which induce conflicts and tensions between groups? Inspired by these questions, this research investigates the ethnic integration process as a consequence of internal migration in a multiethnic society. The present case study deals with the intergroup relations between an in-migrant majority group and a native minority group in a frontier area of China--Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. To conduct this research, a field survey on ""Migration Adjustment and Ethnic interrelations in Xinjiang Region"" was specially designed and implemented from March to September, 1987. A total of 1,549 individual households were interviewed, from whom useable data were obtained for 1,349 heads of households. Two strategies are used in the analysis. One is cross-tabulation; the other is multivariate regression by using Ordinary Least Square analysis of the SPSSx program. The results of the case study support most of the hypotheses. Xinjiang is found to be an ethnic pluralist society with the in-migrant majority people in an advantaged position in political power. The process of interethnic assimilation, especially linguistic and social structural assimilation, has occurred to a certain degree, and constitutes a great change for both ethnic groups, particularly for the indigeneous minority people assimilating with the in-migrant majority people. Yet, the relatively lower level of social psychological assimilation and lack of inter-group marriage imply that a pluralist community in Xinjiang region will persist for a long time. The Chinese government played an important role in the process of ethnic assimilation and internal migration. The country-wide political movements led to ethnic policies, in some situations, being confusing and fluctuating. As a result, policy impacts often offset each other.","minority & ethnic groups , sociology , demographics",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Participants were interviewed in confidential settings on their attitudes towards reconciliation and on other social and economic factors that may have changed since the economic liberalisation of coffee in Rwanda's recent history. Results from correlational analyses suggest that membership in a coffee cooperative, being associated with a particular coffee washing station comparatively longer, and economic as well as general life satisfaction are significant correlates of positive attitudes towards reconciliation among participants, beyond a clear indication that frequent, deep, and pleasant contact with members from the other ethnic group in Rwanda is strongly linked to an attitude of reconciliation. These observations were discernible independent of ethnicity of particular participants, or of the specific ethnic mix of community members in a given survey location, indicating that forgiveness and reconciliation are equally salient for all Rwandans, and that those individuals who benefit from the coffee sector deregulation economically may also experience positive social change as an ancillary result. Although the study's sample represents a minority of coffee farmers in Rwanda, i.e. those benefiting from the results of privatisation in Rwanda's coffee sector, and the survey design prohibits generalisations beyond the group examined, the observed correlations match current theories of reconciliation, and extend the small body of field studies in reconciliation research, thus providing a quantitative insight into the potential mediating effect of commercially induced intergroup contact on positive intergroup relations in post-conflict environments with lingering ethnic discord. Limitations of survey research in post-conflict settings are discussed in conjunction with recommendations for follow-up inquiries on the social factors that may contribute to a reduction in inter-ethnic hostility, even if on the face of it, they may seem utterly unrelated to psychology.

However, there remains an important gap in the current literature regarding RLGD impacts with non-Muslim populations. Further, the moderating effects of sex, race, and national origin (moderating variables [MVs]) have yielded mixed findings concerning anxiety (dependent variable). The intergroup anxiety theory and the integrated threat theory elaborate on perceived threats and potential anxiety of intergroup dynamics. The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the role of religious preferences (independent variable), the MVs, and the RLGD-anxiety relationship. The sample consisted of foreign- and nonforeign-born, Christian theist, non-Christian theist, and nontheist participants from 44 countries and 6 racial groups (N = 414). The direct impact of RLGD through religious intergroup contact (Outgroup Contact Measure) and anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory) was measured via regression analyses. While controlling for the MV's, results show that (a) Muslims reported the most religious outgroup contact, whereas, Evangelical/ Fundamentalists reported the least. The (b) most severe differences and the highest and (c) anxiety symptoms were reported by agnostics, atheists, and Muslim women respectively. Findings from this research help clarify that the relationship between RLGD, sex, and anxiety, and show the variation among IV and sex moderations are more unique than initially addressed with Muslims. This is an important contribution to the existing literature and enhances social change by better serving understudied and underrepresented religious preference groups.

The first paper reviews evidence of positive and negative consequences of interracial contact and presents a theoretical model of intergroup dialogue (IGD) focused on promoting positive and avoiding negative outcomes. The second paper tests the efficacy of this model for promoting a particular positive outcome, intergroup empathy. Moving beyond outcome-based analyses, the third paper examines the process by which IGD increases empathy, using structural equation modeling. Higher education research documents the educational benefits of interracial interaction while research in social psychology reveals a complicated picture, showing both positive and negative effects. It is argued that contact must be both structured and guided in ways that actively prevent negative outcomes while promoting positive outcomes. To that end, a critical-dialogic model of IGD is proposed, centering on communication processes as an avenue toward intergroup relationships, understanding and collaboration. Empirical evidence supporting this model is reviewed and implications for policy are discussed. In 26 field experiments, n =737 students were randomized to a standardized IGD course or to a control group and evaluated pre-post and 1-year later. Participants in IGD demonstrate increased empathy at posttest and one-year later relative to participants in a randomized control group and 13 course comparisons ( n =236), which focused on race content but did not make explicit use of a dialogic model. Differences between IGD and course comparison groups were mediated in part by communication processes in dialogue. Effects were similar for members of advantaged and disadvantaged racial/ethnic groups. As part of the larger randomized trial in the second paper, data from participants ( n =727) in 26 race and 26 gender dialogues were used to examine how pedagogical features, communication and psychological processes in IGD together foster short- (pre-post) and long-term (1-year later) increases in intergroup empathy. Results demonstrate strong empirical support for the hypothesized process model, with no differences between race and gender dialogues. Together, these papers document both efficacy and process for a critical-dialogic model of intergroup communication, highlighting IGD's unique pedagogy and communication processes as active ingredients for promoting positive intergroup outcomes.","higher education administration , social psychology , multicultural education , pedagogy , higher education",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

An explorative questionnaire survey was undertaken. Random samples of 831 Afrikaans-speaking whites and 846 coloureds were drawn from the Cape metropolitan area.

Separate analyses were done for the 455 white and 428 coloured employed respondents in the original samples. No significant differences were found in the experience of personal-ingroup deprivation, but coloureds did experience significantly more personal-outgroup and ingroup-outgroup deprivation. More variance was also explained for coloureds, especially for working coloureds. Evidently work contact stimulated the drawing of social comparisons with whites. Perceived legitimacy was however the most important predictor of ethnic attitudes for all the groups. While the legitimacy of the own situation was the principal predictor for the total group of whites, the situation of the ingroup was more important to the working whites. Apparently the work situation sensitized whites to the situation of the ingroup. The results underscore the important influence that perceived. differences could have in intergroup relations.

Participants in the study were 193 dyads of pre-adolescent to young adult first and second generation immigrants and one of their parents. All participants were either of Moroccan or Romanian ascent, the two largest immigrant groups in Spain. The proposed SEM model had an adequate fit, chi2(2, N = 193) = 2.272, p = .321, RMSEA = .027, CFI = .999, NFI = .994, and yielded a large R2, both for the Moroccan group (R2 = .79, p < .01), and the Romanian group (R2 = .80, p < .01). It showed that the value dimension openness to change vs. conservation is positively related to their experience of discrimination (beta = .35, p < .01, for Moroccans group; and beta = .29, p < .001, for Romanians). This relationship was mediated by parental values and their parents' experience of discrimination. A possible explanation is that immigrants high in openness to change are likely to pursue contact with the host culture more intensely, and thus increase the probability of interactions involving discrimination. Additionally, parental values and their own experience of discrimination influences their children, making them more vulnerable to discrimination stress and more likely to perceive discrimination. While most research is focused on external or environmental variables, this study highlights the importance of value orientations and parental influences in immigrants' experience of discrimination.

The status relations of the two groups were assessed by examining advantages, disadvantages and subjective characteristics attributed to the groups. Close contact between groups may account for the unexpected reduction in intergroup differentiation when explict comparisons were made. No greater illegitimacy in perceived status relations was reported by the low status group, although more dissatisfactions were evidenced in terms of attributed disadvantages, a less positive ingroup identification, and a high proportion of the low status group who want change either through movement into the superior group, or by dissolving status relations through the merging of the two groups. Attempts to merge are geared towards increasing similarity between groups by gaining recognition for those high status characteristics the group believes it has acquired. With a view to social change, the non‐mobile low status subgroup are evolving a new and positive social identity for the group, perceiving little difference between groups.

Experiences and attitudes for close interethnic friendships were investigated. Friendship patterns and predictors were quantitatively assessed for the 114 Natives, with qualitative examination of the development and qualities of the six friend pairs. Results of quantitative analysis revealed that 80% of this sample reported friendship investment with Whites, and 55% reported friendship investment with sametribe members. Over 90% of participants were open to engaging in friendships with member of any ethnicity or race. Approximately 98% of participants reported being targeted for racial discrimination, with most reporting some distress, often at a low level. Significant positive correlates of past and future friendships with Whites included: household income in childhood, identification with White culture, racial/ethnic composition of students in college, multicultural experiences, and past support from parents. Multiple regressions included as significant predictors of past friendships: past parental support (t = 6.488, p &lt; .001), past multicultural experiences (t = 3.852, p &lt; .001), racial composition in college (t = 3.083, p = .003), and diversity climate in high school (t = 2.468, p = .015). Multiple regressions for future friendships with Whites revealed as significant predictors: past friendships (t = 5.187, p &lt; .001), and past parental support (t = 2.507, p = .014). Qualitative findings revealed authenticity/acceptance, communication, similarity, and trust as aspects of close friendships with non-Natives. Opportunities to share cultural teachings, and shared cultural interests helped friendships develop. Participants’ descriptions of their friendships largely coincided with contact/opportunity theories, with propinquity allowing homophily, reciprocation, and disclosure to develop within the friendship. All friendship pairs weathered periods of time during which contact between friends became infrequent, but all participants asserted that they were still close friends during those periods.

Kim, Tae Yeun",2015,The influence of perceived racial discrimination on depressive symptoms and school outcomes among Asian American adolescents,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Asian American (AA) adolescents typically receive attention for their successful academic achievement, but rarely for their difficulties and problems. They show a paradoxical and unique developmental pattern of poor psychological well-being despite fewer problem behaviors and better school outcomes. To shed light on this unique pattern, the current study examines one of the factors that might be most important, although largely unexplored: racial discrimination. In addition, significant differences exist in youth outcomes across Asian subgroups. Specifically, this study examines how perceived racial discrimination influences depressive symptoms and school outcomes among three subgroups of AA adolescents, those of Cambodian, Korean, and Vietnamese dissent. It considers whether and how co-ethnic friendship, ethnic identity, and social support mediate the negative influence of perceived discrimination on depressive symptoms and school outcomes for Cambodian American (CA), Korean American (KA), and Vietnamese American (VA) adolescents. Two datasets were used: one from the Korean American Families (KAF) Project and the other from the Cross Cultural Families (CCF) Project. The KAF Project surveyed KA (n = 220) adolescents in middle school and their parents living in Midwest metropolitan areas in 2007 and 2008. The CCF Project is a five-year longitudinal study of a panel of CA (n = 164) and VA (n = 163) youth and their mothers, which started in 2001 with third through sixth graders in a Pacific Northwest public school district. The present study used Time 1 data for youth (KAF) collected in 2007 and Wave 4 data for youth (CCF) collected in 2004, in which youth participants’ age ranges were comparable between the three groups. Path analysis was conducted using MPlus to test the hypothesized relationships between perceived discrimination and adolescent outcomes (i.e., depressive symptoms, school misbehaviors, grades) and several mediators (i.e., co-ethnic friendship, ethnic identity, social support). The results are consistent with a story that suggests that perceived discrimination increased depressive symptoms for KA and VA adolescents, but it increased school misbehaviors only for CA adolescents. Among KA adolescents, perceived racial discrimination increased ethnic identity, which in turn increased social support, thereby reducing depressive symptoms. The results for KA adolescents show the significant mitigating role of the mediators on the negative impact of perceived discrimination on mental health. Conversely, among VA adolescents, perceived discrimination was not associated with ethnic identity, but ethnic identity was related to social support, which in turn was associated with lower depressive symptoms, fewer misbehaviors in school and better grades. Similarly, among CA adolescents, discrimination and ethnic identity were not significantly associated, but having more co-ethnic friendship was related to more social support, and related to lower depressive symptoms, fewer misbehaviors in school and better grades This study offers insights into the way in which perceived racial discrimination may exert a negative impact on children’s mental health and school outcomes and how the mechanisms that explain this relationship vary across AA subgroups. The results provide several implications for practice. For example, ethnic identity and social support should be targeted for intervention as they could improve the mental health and academic outcomes of youth across all AA subgroups. Perceived discrimination increases ethnic identity, but only among KA youth. This finding might indicate that the experience of adversity can be less detrimental if adversities such as racial discrimination can serve as an opportunity to strengthen a protective factor like ethnic identity. It is intriguing, however, that perceived racial discrimination did not strengthen ethnic identity among VA and CA adolescents. These findings of varying mechanisms across subgroups provide additional empirical support to tailor interventions for various AA subgroups.",social work,Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Results show that about half of Blacks and Hispanics have feared discrimination in the past year. Multivariate results indicate that fear is most likely if one has experienced victimization first-hand and when one's parent is affected by discrimination.

This study intended to examine the status of cooperation among ethnic congregations of multiethnic Catholic parishes, to identify the factors influencing this cooperative alliance, and to explore the relationships between demographic, organizational, and psychological variables and the parishioners' cooperative attitude. Theoretical framework . Since cooperation in a multiethnic context is a complex social phenomenon, the theoretical framework of the study includes conceptual components from several branches of learning: cooperation theories, diversity management, social psychology, and contact hypothesis. Methodology . The researcher collected data from 396 parishioners of six multiethnic/multicongregational parishes of the diocese of Orange, California using his partially customized survey instrument, and analyzed them with both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. Findings . The data analysis revealed that shared goals are the most significant predicator of the status of cooperation, and status inequality is an especially manifest issue among ethnic congregations. There is a positive correlation between the parishioners' cooperative attitude and their inter-ethnic contact. A positive relationship was also found between the parishioners' cooperation and both their parish identification and their ethnic congregation identification. In addition, there is a significant difference between parishioners of diverse positions within parish organization in displaying their inter-ethnic cooperation; however, no significant difference was found between parishioners from diverse ethnic groups. Implications and recommendations . The study results can take the theories of reference beyond their conventional contentions by suggesting a contextualization of social identification, the importance of ideological factor in diversity management, and the priority of affective dimension in social contact. Three specific recommendations regarding multiethnic ministry policy consisting of joint parish pastoral councils, fair resource reallocation, and diversity leadership development for priests and lay leaders were also proposed with the purpose of improving cooperative relationship among ethnic congregations.

It has also been proposed that supportive contact (i.e., positive contact with advantaged group members who express explicit support for social change) may be a special form of contact that might increase, rather than reduce collective action engagement among disadvantaged group members. In the present research, we tested this proposition by asking Gay (N = 96) and Lesbian (N = 100) Australians to recall a previous positive interaction with a heterosexual friend who was either very supportive or somewhat supportive of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered (LGBT) rights (i.e., equal marriage, adoption, and surrogacy rights). Results revealed that the effect of supportive contact on collective action intentions depended on the participants' specific disadvantaged group membership. For Gay men, those who recalled supportive contact reported greater collective action intentions. The opposite pattern emerged for Lesbian women. These findings suggest that supportive contact has the power to enhance or undermine collective action intentions among the disadvantaged. Which of these occurs appears to depend on the specific disadvantaged group to which one belongs. The psychological underpinnings of these effects, the theoretical implications, and future research directions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)
Impact Statement
Public Significance Statement-Despite the clear group-based injustice faced by LGBT Australians, the majority of LGBT Australians do not participate in collective action. Social psychological research has offered a range of explanations for non-participation in collective action. The current research focuses on the potential for contact with advantaged group members to undermine the psychological states that encourage collective action among disadvantaged group members. Building on earlier research, we suggest that supportive contact with openly supportive advantaged group members may enhance collective action engagement. Results revealed that the effect of supportive contact depended on the participants' specific disadvantaged group membership (Gay men or Lesbian women), and suggest that supportive contact has the power to enhance or undermine collective action intentions among disadvantaged group members.

The current research aimed to test imagined contact effects on minority group members' acculturation strategies (contact participation and culture maintenance), perceived discrimination, feelings of belongingness, and social acceptance across three studies conducted in the United Kingdom (Study 1) and Turkey (Studies 2 and 3). Method: The sample consisted of Eastern Europeans in Study 1 (N = 63) and Kurds in Study 2 and 3 (N = 66 and 210, respectively). Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions (control vs. imagined contact) and completed measures of acculturation, perceived discrimination, general belongingness, and social acceptance. Results: Findings showed that while imagined contact significantly reduced perceived discrimination and culture maintenance, and increased contact participation and social acceptance among Eastern Europeans (Study 1), it reduced social acceptance and contact participation among Kurds recruited from a conflict-ridden homogeneous setting (Study 2). With a larger and more heterogeneous sample of Kurds (Study 3), these effects occurred only among those with higher ingroup identification. Moreover, in all studies social acceptance mediated the effects of imagined contact on contact participation and perceived discrimination. Discussion. Findings offer important insights about the use of the imagined contact strategy among minority group members and imply the need to take into account the context-dependent nature of contact strategies.

The ethnic minority group participants were found to be much more in favor of multiculturalism than the majority group. Furthermore, ingroup identification, perceived discrimination, outgroup friendships, and the two ideological notions appeared to be related independently to multiculturalism. However, high ethnic identification was related to lower endorsement of multiculturalism among the majority group and to higher endorsement of multiculturalism among the minority group.

Today, 9 million Americans identify with multiple races, and the election of President Obama—a son of biracial parentage—has increased public interest in multiracialism. Using a combination of national surveys and qualitative interviews, this dissertation breaks down the political ramifications of race-mixing and multiracial identity, with a focus on biracial Americans of White-Black parentage. Analyses begin with an assessment of public opinion towards interracial marriage. Findings show that expressed support for intermarriage has increased over the past decade—both through changes in attitudes and through a cohort replacement effect—driven mostly by increasingly progressive views from Whites. Expressed support is inflated by political correctness, as respondents are less likely to claim support when speaking with someone believed to be of their same racial group. Opposition to interracial marriage is not merely evidence of respondents' racial in-group preferences, but also a disfavoring towards specific racial outgroups, as some out-groups (e.g., Blacks) are considered less desirable marriage partners than others (e.g., Whites). Turning to the identities and attitudes of biracials, findings show that the majority of White-Black biracials now opt to identify as both White and Black—but that nearly 40 percent of biracials continue to subscribe to the one-drop rule, labeling themselves as singularly Black. Biracials' outlook is significantly shaped by family, sociocultural environment, religion, region, and gender. Results also indicate that “money whitens” biracials' self-identification; all else equal, biracials from the most affluent families are more likely to identify as singularly White or White-Black than as singularly Black. Confirming a racial assimilationist effect, biracials adopt the identity of the racial group with which they have the most contact. Regarding policy attitudes, findings show that while identification as partly Black is important in believing that racial discrimination is a major problem in society, simply being of Black heritage leads to significantly more liberal attitudes towards explicitly and implicitly racial policies. Furthermore, on issues involving women and gay rights, biracial individuals who identify as White-Black or singularly Black express more progressive views than monoracial Whites and monoracial Blacks. Interviews further break down biracials' identities, and suggest that skin color is mostly uncorrelated with racial and political loyalties. The dissertation concludes with a discussion of what the rise in intermarriage and growth of the American multiracial population means, symbolically and substantively, for the future of American race relations.","african american studies , black studies , political science , ethnic studies",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

On the one hand, socialising with higher-status alters might enable individuals to access valuable resources. On the other hand, status-discrepant friendships could be detrimental to mental health by engendering feelings of unfairness. We sought to examine the impact of status-discrepant social relationships on depressive symptoms in the 2012 Korean General Social Survey (KGSS), a nationally representative sample. We show that socialising with higher-status people is positively associated with depressive symptoms. There is no significant difference between those socialising with equivalent-status or with lower-status alters. Perceived unfairness also increase depressive symptoms. Respondents socialising with higher-status alters tend to report greater depressive symptoms as their perceived unfairness increases. Gender-stratified analyses reveal that the detrimental impact of status-discrepant relationships are observed for men only, not for women. These findings suggest that socialising with higher-status people can be a net detriment for mental wellbeing by increasing stress/frustration or decreasing psychological resources such as self-esteem, and that these effects are more pronounced for individuals who perceive that society is unfair. This pattern appears stronger for men, which might be associated with gender roles internalised through gender socialisation processes. © 2017 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness",depressive symptoms; gender; perceived unfairness; relative deprivation; social comparison; social relationships; social status; south korea,Article,Final,Scopus

However, the acculturation expectations have received relatively less attention from researchers, and support for multiculturalism has rarely been examined from the perspective of immigrants. The present study used the framework of the Mutual Intercultural Relations in Plural Societies (MIRIPS) project to investigate the acculturation experiences and intercultural relations in Hong Kong by incorporating mutual views of both the dominant and non-dominant groups. It also tested the mediating role of the dominant group's tolerance towards different cultural groups and the non-dominant group's perceived discrimination. Two community samples were recruited, including Hong Kong residents (N = 181) and immigrants from Mainland China (N = 182). Among Mainland immigrants, the integration strategy predicted both psychological adaptation and sociocultural adaptation. Multicultural ideology predicted psychological adaptation and played a significant role in intercultural contact with Hong Kong people through the mediation of lower perceived discrimination. Among Hong Kong residents, the integration expectation predicted psychological adaptation. Multicultural ideology indirectly affected intercultural contact with Mainland immigrants through the mediation of greater tolerance. These results suggest that the integration strategy and expectation are more important to intrapersonal functioning, whereas multicultural ideology may be more crucial in facilitating social interactions between members of the society of settlement and immigrants in culturally plural milieus. Future research should test the proposed models of dominant and non-dominant groups in other cultures.

A three-wave longitudinal survey of East and West Germans between 1996 and 2000 reveals generally positive effects of contact on well-being and various measures of satisfaction, although conditions are not very favourable for contact. For example, the continuing disadvantage of East Germans leads to negative effects on some dimensions, because contact makes this disadvantage salient. Overall, effects of contact are stronger and more beneficial for the minority East Germans, compared to majority West Germans.

A group of Gautreaux youth (n = 38), who relocated to predominantly black urban areas served as a control group. In addition, the suburban Gautreaux youth were compared with a black, suburban, public school sample (n = 691) from the High School and Beyond national survey. Suburban Gautreaux youth spent more time outside of school with white peers and had more white friends than the city control group. Time spent with white friends outside of school was positively and significantly correlated with reflected appraisal for the suburban group, but not for the city group. Incidents of name-calling and threats in the suburbs were minimal compared to the positive friendships established with white peers. Self-esteem was high for both Gautreaux groups, with no significant differences. A multivariate path analysis indicated correlation between peer interaction and reflected appraisal, reflected appraisal and self-esteem, and self-esteem and future expectations for the suburban movers only. Results of the comparison showed that the Gautreaux suburban youth had significantly higher self-esteem and lower reflected appraisal than the High School and Beyond group. Both groups showed positive significant correlations between reflected appraisal and self-esteem. It appears that the Gautreaux movers' self-esteem and reflected appraisal were not reduced by their social standings in suburban communities, although future research might show that the experience of dislocation sensitized Gautreaux youth to the negative views of others. This study concluded that the Gautreaux housing initiative resulted in successful social and personal adaptation to a dissonant cultural context for those participants who experienced the greatest socio-economic differences between themselves and neighbors in white, middle-income, suburban communities.","academic guidance counseling , minority & ethnic groups , sociology , welfare , public administration , african americans",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Expectations of racial discrimination were assessed using vignettes of cross-race social situations involving an African American child in a social interaction with European Americans. There were 3 major findings. First, expectations for discrimination declined slightly from 3rd to 5th grade. Second, although racial composition of children's classrooms, number of European American friends, gender, and family poverty status were largely unrelated to social expectations, having more African American friends was associated with expecting more discrimination in cross-racial interactions from 3rd to 5th grade. Third, increases in racial centrality were related to increases in discrimination expectations, and increases in public regard were associated with decreases in discrimination expectations.

The Survey of Black Women's Perceptions was used to measure degree of self-esteem enhancement of childhood socialization messages, levels of success related to the Life Tasks of Work, Love, Friendship, and Relationship to God, and perceived frequency of experiences of racial and gender discrimination. The hypotheses were that the global self-esteems and the situational self-esteems of Professional Black women would be affected by perceived racial discrimination, perceived gender discrimination, and childhood socialization messages, and that the global self-esteems of Professional Black women would be affected by the Life Tasks of Work, Love, Friendship, and Relationship to God. Pearson product moment correlation and multiple regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Although some of the findings were tentative and suggestive, the findings regarding global self-esteem, and the Life Tasks of Love and Friendship were highly significant. Global self-esteem was positively affected by all of the Life Tasks in general, by the Life Tasks of Love and Relationship to God in particular, and by gender discrimination from white men on the job. Global self-esteem was negatively affected by gender discrimination from white males outside of work. Global self-esteem was inversely correlated with racial discrimination from other Blacks outside of work and with gender discrimination from white males outside of work. Global self-esteem was positively correlated with all of the Life Tasks. The Life Task of Love was negatively affected by childhood socialization messages from women outside the family concerning what it meant to be female. The Life Task of Friendship was affected overall by the interaction of racial discrimination, gender discrimination, and childhood socialization messages, and in particular by childhood socialization messages from women outside the family concerning what it meant to be Black. Hypotheses concerning situational self-esteems related to the Life Tasks of Work and Relationship to God were not supported.","personality , womens studies , minority & ethnic groups , sociology",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Overall, Malay students reported significantly poorer sociocultural adjustment than Chinese students, as well as more negative outcomes on a range of predictors. Path analysis for the total sample showed that higher family income led to greater sociocultural adjustment, but partially because it led to more contact with host and conationals, better language proficiency, lower perceived cultural differences and less perceived discrimination. Moreover, participants with higher English proficiency were better adapted, but partially because they perceived less cultural differences as well as having more contact with host nationals. Additionally, individuals reporting better sociocultural adjustment also reported better health statuses. The same model was equally useful at predicting sociocultural adjustment for both Malay and Chinese participants. These results are discussed in terms of the role played by income in buffering against the negative aspects of sociocultural adjustment.

Among a great number of ethnic groups living in Kabardino-Balkaria, Kabardians and Balkars are one of the largest (they are so-called titular ethnic groups). Russians are the second largest of the ethnic groups after Kabardians. We report here the results of an empirical study of the intercultural relations, mutual acculturation, and adaptation of Kabardians and Balkars (N = 285) and Russians (N = 249). Specifically, we examine the relevance of three hypotheses formulated to understand intercultural relations: the multiculturalism hypothesis, the integration hypothesis, and the contact hypothesis. We conducted path analysis in AMOS with two samples: a sample of Russians and a sample of the two main ethnic groups (Kabardians and Balkars), and we further compared the path models with each other. The results revealed significant effects of security, intercultural contacts, multicultural ideology, acculturation strategies, and acculturation expectations on attitudes, life satisfaction, and self-esteem in both samples. These findings partially confirm the three hypotheses in both groups. However, we also identified a regionally specific pattern. We found that, in the Russian sample, the integration strategy was negatively related to wellbeing, while contact with the dominant ethnic group was positively related to well-being. At the same time, in the sample of Kabardians and Balkars, acculturation expectations of integration and assimilation were positively related to well-being. In the article, we discuss these regional specifics.

And fourth, what are important additional determinants of national identification among immigrants? The results show that, compared to Dutch natives, Turkish but not Moroccan immigrants have lower national identification.

This study represents a pioneering effort in investigating whether the post-9/11 backlash against Arabs and Muslims has penetrated community college campuses, focusing upon the inter-relationships among the level of perceived discrimination, the degree of diversity of Arab and Muslim students’ campus friendships, and their sense of belonging to the college. Two conflict theories are advanced to explain why perceived discrimination might promote ethnic and religious clustering among Arab and Muslim community college students. The study employs a mixed methods design consisting of a 92-item survey and three focus groups. The survey sample consists of 753 Arab Christian, Arab Muslim, and non-Arab Muslim students from 21 community colleges in Southern California and Southeast Michigan. The primary finding was that there was a modest but positive relationship between the level of perceived discrimination and the percentage of campus friends who are of the same ethnicity but different religion. Student focus groups furnished insight into some students' reluctance to report discrimination in surveys. The implications of the study are to develop sensitive measures of the campus climate that draw out more subtle forms of discrimination.

Among Jews, the encounter enhanced readiness for contact by increasing empathy and hope and decreasing hatred. Elevated support for equal rights to Palestinian citizens was mediated by higher hope and lower perceived equality.

In Study 1, participants were assigned to either high- or low-power experimental groups and then brought together to discuss either commonalities between the groups or intergroup differences. Commonality-focused contact, relative to difference-focused contact, produced heightened expectations for fair (i.e., egalitarian) out-group behavior among members of disadvantaged groups. These expectations, however, proved unrealistic when compared against the actions of members of the advantaged groups. Participants in Study 2 were Israeli Arabs (a disadvantaged minority) who reported the amount of positive contact they experienced with Jews. More positive intergroup contact was associated with increased perceptions of Jews as fair, which in turn predicted decreased support for social change. Implications for social change are considered.

The strength ideal is internalized as an integral aspect of their identity, so much so that Black women socialize each other to habituate behaviors reflecting strength. The Strong Black Woman Collective Theory (SBWC; Davis, 2015a) posits that Black women re-appropriate the strong Black woman image and use certain communication behaviors to affirm strength in each other. By exhibiting these behaviors, they delineate a safe space to promote solidarity within the group and confront oppressors collectively. This new theory needs to be corroborated with empirical data to examine how the theoretical tenets are actualized in a real-world communication context. To this end, the present study conducts a partial test of the SBWC theory by observing Black women friend groups engage in supportive discussions about racial discrimination. This is an ideal context to test the SBWC theory because the friends are gathering together as a group of same race-gendered persons; they are discussing the wrongdoing of an identifiable external hostility that they are motivated to retreat from and confront; and strength gets reified as a form of support during the conversation. The study advances a path model to represent the empirical associations among four key variables: strength regulation, group identification and solidarity, verbal confrontation, and relational quality with the out-group member. Fifty-two Black women friends groups (three in each) aged 18–89 years were sampled but only the data from the support seeker were used for analyses ( n = 52). All data were collected in the home of one of the participants as a way to observe the supportive conversation in a safe, naturalistic environment. Structural Equation Modeling was used to test the Strong Black Woman Collective path model. The findings revealed that strength regulation was positively associated with group identification/solidarity, such that women felt more connected to the group when strength was regulated and reinforced. Also verbal derogation was inversely associated with relational satisfaction with the White woman aggressor. That is, support seekers reported lower levels of relational satisfaction with the White woman after she was verbally derogated during the discussion. The results also showed that strength regulation was positively correlated with verbal derogation, even though the relationship was approaching significance. Finally, verbal derogation had a very weak and nonsignificant association with group identification/solidarity. Findings from this study demonstrate that strength is functional in the context of Black women’s communication spaces and has important implications for their relationships with in-group affiliates and outsiders. The conclusion of this dissertation discusses the implications of these findings in relation to future articulations of the SBWC theory, extent research in Feminist Studies and Communication, and Black women’s day-to-day encounters with discrimination.","black studies , womens studies , communication",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

They show a paradoxical and unique developmental pattern of poor psychological well-being despite fewer problem behaviors and better school outcomes. To shed light on this unique pattern, the current study examines one of the factors that might be most important, although largely unexplored: racial discrimination. In addition, significant differences exist in youth outcomes across Asian subgroups. Specifically, this study examines how perceived racial discrimination influences depressive symptoms and school outcomes among three subgroups of AA adolescents, those of Cambodian, Korean, and Vietnamese dissent. It considers whether and how co-ethnic friendship, ethnic identity, and social support mediate the negative influence of perceived discrimination on depressive symptoms and school outcomes for Cambodian American (CA), Korean American (KA), and Vietnamese American (VA) adolescents. Two datasets were used: one from the Korean American Families (KAF) Project and the other from the Cross Cultural Families (CCF) Project. The KAF Project surveyed KA (n = 220) adolescents in middle school and their parents living in Midwest metropolitan areas in 2007 and 2008. The CCF Project is a five-year longitudinal study of a panel of CA (n = 164) and VA (n = 163) youth and their mothers, which started in 2001 with third through sixth graders in a Pacific Northwest public school district. The present study used Time 1 data for youth (KAF) collected in 2007 and Wave 4 data for youth (CCF) collected in 2004, in which youth participants' age ranges were comparable between the three groups. Path analysis was conducted using MPlus to test the hypothesized relationships between perceived discrimination and adolescent outcomes (i.e., depressive symptoms, school misbehaviors, grades) and several mediators (i.e., co-ethnic friendship, ethnic identity, social support). The results are consistent with a story that suggests that perceived discrimination increased depressive symptoms for KA and VA adolescents, but it increased school misbehaviors only for CA adolescents. Among KA adolescents, perceived racial discrimination increased ethnic identity, which in turn increased social support, thereby reducing depressive symptoms. The results for KA adolescents show the significant mitigating role of the mediators on the negative impact of perceived discrimination on mental health. Conversely, among VA adolescents, perceived discrimination was not associated with ethnic identity, but ethnic identity was related to social support, which in turn was associated with lower depressive symptoms, fewer misbehaviors in school and better grades. Similarly, among CA adolescents, discrimination and ethnic identity were not significantly associated, but having more co-ethnic friendship was related to more social support, and related to lower depressive symptoms, fewer misbehaviors in school and better grades. This study offers insights into the way in which perceived racial discrimination may exert a negative impact on children's mental health and school outcomes and how the mechanisms that explain this relationship vary across AA subgroups. The results provide several implications for practice. For example, ethnic identity and social support should be targeted for intervention as they could improve the mental health and academic outcomes of youth across all AA subgroups. Perceived discrimination increases ethnic identity, but only among KA youth. This finding might indicate that the experience of adversity can be less detrimental if adversities such as racial discrimination can serve as an opportunity to strengthen a protective factor like ethnic identity. It is intriguing, however, that perceived racial discrimination did not...

The potential conflict between reducing prejudice and supporting engagement in collective action,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"This dissertation investigates how efforts to reduce prejudice and interpersonal discrimination could also undermine collective action by disadvantaged group members. In an extensive line of research, Gaertner, Dovidio and their colleagues have shown that prejudice and interpersonal discrimination against outgroup members can be reduced when identifications are shifted from separate groups to a larger superordinate identities (see Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 2000 for a review). Other investigators (e.g. Ellemers, Kortekaas, &amp; Ouwerkerk, 1999; Simon, Stürmer, &amp; Steffens, 2000) have found that when groups are not evenly situated in social strata, strong identification with one's disadvantaged group is essential for participation in collective action to change unjust social stratification. Thus, the creation of a superordinate identity could undermine disadvantaged group members' identification with their disadvantaged ingroup, consequently reducing their likelihood of engaging in collective action. The two present studies investigate if a potential conflict exists. Study 1 is a secondary analysis of data from a survey of university students of color who were asked about their racial/ethnic identification, their contact with Whites, and their support for engaging in various forms of collective action to benefit their racial/ethnic group. Study 2 is a laboratory experiment that attempts to replicate Gaertner and Dovidio's reduction of prejudice via the creation of superordinate identity, but also includes a manipulation of group disadvantage, and adds measures of interest in engaging in collective action. The findings from both studies suggest that encouraging a superordinate identity has negative effects for collective action. The findings have important implications for understanding how the current directions in reducing intergroup bias, while well intended and extremely important for addressing the negative attitudes and actions of advantaged group members, may also be counter productive for greater social justice concerns.",social psychology,Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Focusing on disadvantaged groups' (i.e., racial/ethnic minorities) orientations toward advantaged groups, the present research experimentally investigated the potential of dual, relative to common, identity to produce greater willingness to engage in contact, while maintaining social change motivation. Relative to common identity, dual identity produced not only greater willingness to engage in contact, which was mediated by perceptions of shared values, but also greater social change motivation, mediated by decreased optimism about future relations. Thus, for dual identity, enhancing approach motivation (willingness for contact) does not necessarily undermine social change motivation.

Results indicate that the general association between contact and interracial closeness is significantly weaker among black respondents than among white respondents. Moreover, while contact relates consistently to greater interracial closeness among white respondents, perceived discrimination moderates this relationship among black respondents, such that significant contact effects are not observed for those who perceive considerable discrimination against their racial group. At the same time, other results suggest that contact in the form of interracial friendships may help to augment black Americans' reports of interracial closeness, and diminish the role of perceived discrimination.

The present study examined the sociocultural adjustment of sojourning Malaysian students in Britain. Eighty-one Malay and 110 Chinese students enrolled in various courses answered a self-report questionnaire that examined various aspects of sociocultural adjustment. A series of one-way analyses of variance showed that Malay participants experienced poorer sociocultural adjustment in comparison with their Chinese counterparts. They were also less likely than Chinese students to have contact with co-nationals and host nationals, more likely to perceive their actual experience in Britain as worse than they had expected, and more likely to perceive greater cultural distance and greater discrimination. The results of regression analyses showed that, for Malay participants, perceived discrimination accounted for the greatest proportion of variance in sociocultural adjustment (73%), followed by English language proficiency (10%) and contact with host nationals (4%). For Chinese participants, English language proficiency was the strongest predictor of sociocultural adjustment (54%), followed by expectations of life in Britain (18%) and contact with host nationals (3%). By contrast, participants' sex, age, and length of residence failed to emerge as significant predictors for either ethnic group. Possible explanations for this pattern of findings are discussed, including the effects of Islamophobia on Malay-Muslims in Britain, possible socioeconomic differences between Malay and Chinese students, and personality differences between the two ethnic groups. The results are further discussed in relation to practical steps that can be taken to improve the sociocultural adjustment of sojourning students in Britain.

Many U.S. medical schools have abandoned affirmative action, limiting the recruitment and reducing the admission of underrepresented minority (URM) students even though research supports the premise that the public benefits from an increase in URM physicians and that URM physicians are likely to serve minority, poor, and Medicaid populations. Faculty and students commonly assume they benefit from peer cultural exchange, and the published evidence for the past two decades supports this notion. This research examined the students' perceptions of the educational merits of a diverse student body by surveying medical students at two schools. Method. In 2000, medical students from all four years at Harvard Medical School and the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine were enrolled in a telephone survey about the relevance of racial diversity (among students) in their medical education. Students responded to the interviewer's questions on a five-point Likert-type scale. Results. Of the 55% of students who could be located, 97% responded to the survey. Students reported having little intercultural contact during their formative years but significantly more interactions during higher education years, especially in medical school. Students reported contacts with diverse peers greatly enhanced their educational experience. They strongly supported strengthening or maintaining current affirmative action policies in admissions. The responses and demography of the Harvard and UCSF students did not differ significantly, nor did they differ for majority students and URM students - all groups overwhelmingly thought that racial and ethnic diversity among their peers enhanced their education.

The present research utilized social structural variables as well as classical and contemporary measures of prejudice and racism to analyze undergraduate students' racial attitudes toward African Americans and support for race-based policy. An 85-question survey on the Internet was administered to undergraduate students at two different time periods during the 2000–01 academic year employing two different data collection techniques. Undergraduate students were contacted in their classes and asked to complete an 85-question survey on the Internet that consisted of primarily five-point Likert items with responses ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” Factor analyses were used to ascertain the empirical independence of the classical and contemporary measures of prejudice and racism. Similar to some previous studies, even though there were strong correlations between some of the classical and contemporary measures of prejudice and racism, the factor analysis yielded old-fashioned and contemporary measures of prejudice and racism as separate measures that can be empirically differentiated. There was no significant course effect on undergraduate students' level of racial prejudice and racism in the first study, and the number of interracial friendships and political conservatism did not have an impact on this relationship. However, in the second study that used a pre/posttest design, students who had already fulfilled their diversity course requirement and were taking additional race-based courses, were less prejudiced than those students who just started their first race-based course. Egalitarianism and affective prejudice are most consequential in predicting levels of opposition for race-based policy designed to reduce racial inequality. Anti-Black affect (negative stereotypes) and individualism significantly explain symbolic racism. Controlling for racial prejudice, political attitudes, and socio-demographic variables revealed that even though undergraduate students adhere to the basic American values of equal opportunity, they are less likely to support race-based policy.","minority & ethnic groups , sociology , bilingual education , multicultural education",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

We examined these links in a survey of Lebanese nationals (advantaged group) and Syrian refugees (disadvantaged group) in the context of a severe economic crisis affecting both groups. We replicated previous research showing that contact predicts outgroup attitudes positively and more strongly among advantaged than among disadvantaged group members. Of importance, we also found evidence suggesting that the relationship between positive contact and collective action may depend on group status and on collective action type. Frequent positive contact reduced nonviolent collective action tendencies among disadvantaged group members but not among advantaged group members. However, more positive frequent contact was linked to lower violence support among both advantaged and disadvantaged group members. These results help shed new light on the potential benefits and limits of intergroup contact as a social change tool. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)
Impact Statement
Public Significance Statement-This paper contributes to research aimed at evaluating intergroup contact as a tool for improving intergroup relations, particularly among Syrian refugees and Lebanese nationals living in two disadvantaged areas in Lebanon, in the context of the Syrian refugee crisis, reportedly the largest humanitarian crisis in recent decades. The results show that more positive frequent intergroup contact is associated with less nonviolent action tendencies among refugees, but not among host communities. Conversely, more positive frequent intergroup contact is associated with less support for violence among both refugees and host communities.

[References],South African Journal of Psychology,41,4,540,551,10.1177/008124631104100412,"Contact theory holds that increased contact between members of different groups can improve intergroup attitudes and reduce prejudice if it meets certain quality criteria, such as equal status, common goals, and cooperation within the contact situation. It is now emerging that even extended contact, or the mere knowledge that an ingroup member has a close relationship with an outgroup member, can lead to more positive intergroup attitudes. However, in South African society optimal contact is uncommon because most social spaces and structures are governed by strong norms of microsegregation that ensure that genuine optimal contact is uncommon. Given that multiracial families exemplify most features of optimal contact while radically challenging social norms of segregation, they may be important nodes for effective prejudice-reducing contact in South African society. This exploratory study investigated the extent to which general contact with people of other races, direct contact with multiracial families (i.e. personally knowing a member of a multiracial family), and extended contact with multiracial families (i.e. knowing someone who knows a member of a multiracial family) predicted reduced prejudice, reconciliatory race-policy attitudes and reduced intergroup threat. The results show that all three forms of contact predicted significantly reduced prejudice and that direct contact with multiracial families significantly predicted reduced prejudice over and above the effect of general interracial contact. Therefore we argue that contact researchers should consider more carefully whether normatively supported contact or radically norm-violating forms of contact optimally disrupt practices of microsegregation. Additionally, we argue that multiracial romantic relationships and families deserve increased attention and support as important nodes of prejudice reduction in South African society. However, general contact was also associated with reduced support for race-based social policies which supports the argument that the prejudice-reducing effects of interracial contact may be at least partially offset by other effects that may hinder broader social change.

Some consider Mexican Americans similar to European Americans of a century ago that arrived in the United States with modest backgrounds but were eventually able to participate fully in society. In contrast, others argue that Mexican Americans have been racialized throughout U.S. history, and this limits their participation in society. The evidence of persistent educational disadvantages across generations and frequent reports of discrimination and stereotyping supports the racialization argument. In this paper, we explore the ways in which race plays a role in the lives of Mexican Americans by examining how education, racial characteristics, social interactions, relate to racial outcomes. We use the Mexican American Study Project, a unique data set based on a 1965 survey of Mexican Americans in Los Angeles and San Antonio combined with surveys of the same respondents and their adult children in 2000, thereby creating a longitudinal and intergenerational data set. First, we found that darker Mexican Americans, therefore appearing more stereotypically Mexican, report more experiences of discrimination. Second, darker men report much more discrimination than lighter men and than women overall. Third, more educated Mexican Americans experience more stereotyping and discrimination than their less educated counterparts, which is partly due to their greater contact with whites. Lastly, having greater contact with whites leads to experiencing more stereotyping and discrimination. Our results are indicative of the ways in which Mexican Americans are racialized in the United States.

Psychological research theorizes social support to be a potent buffer against the negative effects of stress on health (Cohen, 2004; Taylor, 2011). For Black Americans, however, social support’s role in buffering health against the negative effects of racism is less clear. These equivocal findings may be because researchers do not know much about the complex dynamics of effective social support in the context of racism. Two studies examined the role of same- and cross-race friends in social support exchanges, and whether that social support benefited Black Americans’ emotional wellbeing. Study 1 examined which friends 31 Black Americans ( M age =19.7, SD=1.70; 74% women) sought for social support in response to racism, and whether they found it helpful. Participants completed measures of perceived discrimination, perceived social support, and emotional closeness with their same- and cross-race friends, and participated in semi-structured focus group interviews discussing racism and social support. Findings revealed that participants reported more emotional closeness to Black friends and non-Black friends of color relative to White friends. Furthermore, 65% of participants reported preferring social support from Black friends to non-Black friends because of their increased ability to understand racism. Study 2 examined how support provision and responsiveness (i.e., feeling understood) provided in same-race ( n dyad =16) and cross-race ( n dyad =30) dyadic friendship interactions impacted Black participants emotional wellbeing. Actor-partner interdependence models found that receiving social support increased Black participants’ emotional closeness to their same- and cross-race friends and decreased participants’ feelings of negative emotions. Responsiveness in same-race interactions, however, increased feelings of negative emotions. This finding may suggest that responsiveness and social support serve different functions in contexts where both friends are negatively impacted by a chronic stressor like racism, and talking about it becomes emotionally draining because there is little recourse to eliminate the stressor. Altogether, the current studies suggest that social support in response to racism does benefit Black Americans’ emotional wellbeing.",psychology,Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Their availability and strength have been shown to predict lower levels of depression, higher self esteem, and higher life satisfaction. They can also alleviate the stress that often leads to negative mental health outcomes. However, studies examining the stress process rarely consider the fact that social networks like friendship groups are not a static resource that effects all people the same way. Rather, demographic characteristics of both the individual and their friends could change the role of friendship networks within the stress process. In this thesis, I investigate the importance of one such demographic characteristic: race. Racial and ethnic diversity continues to grow in the United States, contributing to an increase interracial and interethnic friendships. It is important to understand what impact racial difference might have on the stress process. In addition to using Leonard Peralin’s stress process model to understand these potential effects, I draw upon Gordon Allport’s Contact theory to inform my analysis. Contact Theory attempts to explain why and how intergroup contact leads to changes in racial attitudes. Increases in positive racial attitudes may lower unique stressors often experienced my racial minorities such as racial prejudice and acculturation. This research project provides a starting point for deeper analyses examining how contact theory and the stress process function together. I ask if racially diverse friendship networks affect adolescent mental well being (as measured by mental health and self-esteem) and if the race of the respondent moderate the effects of racial diversity in friendship networks on mental well-being. To answer these questions, I perform secondary data analysis of survey responses from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. I use public-use, cross-sectional data of adolescents from Wave 1 (’94–’95). Linear regression models predicting adolescent mental health found that racial difference in friendship networks is negatively associated with mental health for white adolescents. For Asian respondents, linear regression models found that racial difference in friendship networks was positively associated with both mental health and self-esteem. Results on Hispanic, Black, and “Other” race adolescents were non-significant. These results suggest that racial difference in friendship networks have varying associations on mental well-being that depend on the race of the adolescent. White adolescents with more diverse friend groups may experience increased stress resulting from an increased awareness of the racial prejudice that affects their friend’s lives. Asian adolescents may benefit from more diverse friend groups because it allows them to find a “sense of belonging” in environments where there is less opportunity to have same-race friendship networks. They also might face less discrimination from different-race peers, allowing the social support benefits of a racially different friendship networks to outweigh any increases in perceived discrimination from peers. The results indicate that future studies should continue studying how demographic characteristics influence the stress process, including the role of social networks. Policies should aim to provide educational resources teaching adolescents how to handle experiences of prejudice and to create positive points of contact for different race peers. Future studies should assess the validity of these results by performing longitudinal analyses that can provide information on how racially different friendship networks buffer specific stressors and discover if the relationships found in this analysis change over time.","mental health , social psychology , sociology",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Kamiejski, De Oliveira, and Guimond apply several theories in exploration of the variables related to the development of the existent ethnic tensions in this region. Policy models are also evaluated and considered as means of engendering harmony in the future. Discussion of the most recent and largest immigrant group to France, the Maghrebians, reveals several factors associated with increasing tensions including the large degree of assumed difference in values, religion, and culture. The authors recognize that France has set the stage for positive interethnic relations with its policy of a neutral state and equality of all citizens. However, evidence contrary to this policy is noted in recent political and media activities which, as the authors demonstrate through research, serve to reinforce differences and exacerbate ethnic tensions. Emphasis is placed on several theories that explain attitudes toward immigrants and these are applied to the development of current ethnic tensions in France. Kamiejski, De Oliveira, and Guimond present five factors that they believe, and research has concluded, to be applicable: Threat, relative deprivation and gratification, SDO, national identity, and acculturation orientation. The Social Identity Model of Collective Action is applied to the recent riots in France that the authors attribute to social activism. Kamiejski, De Oliveira, and Guimond conclude by offering suggestions to improve interethnic relations, such as the use of the contact hypothesis to reduce prejudice. Analysis of various forms of policy and the associated implications on interethnic relations is presented and a solution specific to the situation in France is offered.

Intergroup dialogue addresses one of the central concerns in contemporary research on intergroup contact between groups with distinct social statuses: Do identity salience and positive relationships mobilize or sedate collective action on the part of disadvantaged or advantaged groups? We explicate how IGD addresses the concerns through its theoretical and practice model. IGD pedagogy-content, structured interaction, and facilitation-fosters critical-dialogic communication processes that in turn impact cognitive and affective psychological processes. These two kinds of processes then produce outcomes. Results from a longitudinal, multi-site field experiment of randomly assigned (dialogue and control) students (N = 1437) showed significant treatment effects for dialogue students and strong support for the theoretical model and the centrality of the communication processes. These results support our claim that critical-dialogic intergroup dialogue heightens, not mutes, commitment to action. © Oxford University Press 2018.

The literature has however produced a fuzzy discourse, full of assumptions and claims that are rarely tested. We attempt to disentangle some of these assumptions by providing empirical evidence on the mediating and moderating influence of inter-ethnic conflict and contact, and examine whether they underlie the erosion of health among minorities and white British respondents residing in diverse local areas. Analyses were conducted using multilevel models that relied on geocoded data from a random stratified sample of adults 16–75 years collected in the 2009–2011 Citizenship Survey merged to small area aggregated statistics from the 2011 UK census. The final sample comprised of minorities (n = 13,236) and white British (n = 15,021) residing in England. We find that local area deprivation matters much more for the health of minorities and whites than diversity. Yet, residing in diverse areas can be problematic for whites if it is accompanied by high levels of social distance measured by negative attitudes towards immigrants. Greater contact among minorities and whites, residing in more diverse areas appears to have no significant effect on health. Overall, the findings supported our hypothesis that residing in areas of greater diversity has a differential impact on minorities when compared to whites. In particular, diversity appear to be more beneficial for minorities, especially newly arriving migrants. The effect of contact as measured by social capital is dwarfed in comparison to the effect of deprivation, underlying the importance for policy makers to tackle structural inequalities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",conflict hypothesis; contact hypothesis; discrimination; diversity; england; ethnicity; neighbourhood; self-rated health; social capital,Article,Final,Scopus

Thus, establishing symmetrical communication can be especially important for many interventions conducted to resolve conflicts marked by unequal distribution of power. One such asymmetrical conflict is the one between the Jewish majority and the Arab minority in Israel. This article describes a study that applies our process-evaluation approach to assess equality and social justice in planned contact interventions between Israeli Jews and Arabs by measuring the degree to which members of the two groups contributed equally to the communication between them.

Cultural differences they experience can make the transition difficult, resulting in acculturative stress. Encountering discrimination is, unfortunately, a common concern for international students which may compound acculturative stress. The aim of the current study was to better understand discrimination felt by international students, and how it is related to pre-contact factors, acculturation factors, and adjustment factors. A more thorough understanding of this important, but often overlooked, aspect of acculturation could lead to future interventions designed to improve international student experiences while abroad. Pre-contact factors such as place of origin, physical appearance, age, and religion were examined in addition to acculturation factors such as acculturation strategy, length of time in the United States, English proficiency, and social support. Adjustment factors considered included acculturative stress, perceived discrimination, and inclinations to attribute discrimination. General psychological health was used as an overall outcome measure in order to provide a picture of the importance of the adjustment factors and to allow for comparisons to be made between them. Results suggest that feeling discriminated against is unfortunately common for international students. Country of origin, physical appearance, connectedness to mainstream culture, and English proficiency were found in the study to be particularly important regarding international student experiences. Efforts targeting these variables could improve experiences, and some ideas for such interventions are provided.","behavioral psychology , social psychology",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

By opening a window onto the experiences and evolving identities of individuals in these exceptionally diverse environments, we can gain a better understanding of the possibilities and challenges we face as a multicultural nation. The Diversity Challenge-the largest and most comprehensive study to date on college campus diversity-synthesizes over five years' worth of research by an interdisciplinary team of experts to explore how a highly diverse environment and policies that promote cultural diversity affect social relations, identity formation, and a variety of racial and political attitudes. The result is a fascinating case study of the ways in which individuals grow and groups interact in a world where ethnic and racial difference is the norm. The authors of The Diversity Challenge followed 2,000 UCLA students for five years in order to see how diversity affects identities, attitudes, and group conflicts over time. They found that racial prejudice generally decreased with exposure to the ethnically diverse college environment. Students who were randomly assigned to roommates of a different ethnicity developed more favorable attitudes toward students of different backgrounds, and the same associations held for friendship and dating patterns. By contrast, students who interacted mainly with others of similar backgrounds were more likely to exhibit bias toward others and perceive discrimination against their group. Likewise, the authors found that involvement in ethnically segregated student organizations sharpened perceptions of discrimination and aggravated conflict between groups. The Diversity Challenge also reports compelling new evidence that a strong ethnic identity can coexist with a larger community identity: students from all ethnic groups were equally likely to identify themselves as a part of the broader UCLA community. Overall, the authors note that on many measures, the racial and political attitudes of the students were remarkably consistent throughout the five year study. But the transformations that did take place provide us with a wealth of information on how diversity affects individuals, groups, and the cohesion of a community. Theoretically informed and empirically grounded, The Diversity Challenge is an illuminating and provocative portrait of one of the most diverse college campuses in the nation. The story of multicultural UCLA has significant and far-reaching implications for our nation, as we face similar challenges-and opportunities-on a much larger scale.

I also examined the effect contact with higher earning classes had on feelings of individual relative deprivation. Finally, I conducted an exploratory analysis to see if low wage earners and higher wage earners experienced individual relative deprivation as a result of different facets of their work. The results indicate that individual income is a significant predictor of experiences of individual as well as group relative deprivation, and that individual income does not significantly predict choice of referent. Underemployment was a significant predictor of individual as well as group relative deprivation as well, with those individuals who reported higher levels of underemployment also reporting higher levels of individual and group relative deprivation. The exploratory analysis revealed that the facets of work that elicited feelings of individual relative deprivation were in fact different for low wage earners and higher wage earners, with lower wage earners primarily feeling resentful about meeting their basic needs and maintaining work.

The obtained clusters were validated empirically by comparing groups along relevant variables (e.g., engagement in ethnic and racial socialization, dissatisfaction with racial appearance, birth family interest, perceived discrimination, colorblind attitudes, diversity in friendship networks) on which they would be expected to differ. Finally, I examined the association between these identity profiles and psychological adjustment, including behavioral development and other measures of well-being. Results revealed the emergence of six conceptually unique identity clusters that differed significantly on the various validity constructs measured. However, the identity profiles were largely undifferentiated with respect to behavioral development per parent and adolescent reports on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ, Goodman, 1997).

Results show that contact is associated with lower symbolic and realistic threat for both groups and to lower levels of support for political violence but not to political participation. Symbolic threat mediated the association between contact and support for political violence and between contact and political participation for the Protestant majority group only.

In Chapter 2, I examine factors contributing to perceptions of major lifetime and day-to-day discrimination. Major depressive disorder is the outcome of interest in Chapter 3. I examine its link with racism-related anger and whether or not religiousness serves as a resource, protecting mental health. In Chapter 4, I examine self-rated health, its association with perceived group and interpersonal racism, and the utility of political involvement in combating the deleterious health effects of perceived racism. The data for this project come from the adult sample of the National Survey of American Life (NSAL) and the National Survey of American Life-Self-Administered Questionnaire (NSALSAQ), which are part of the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES) data collection. The NSAL is unique in that it provides the first ever national sample of Caribbean Black Americans, the majority of whom are from or trace their heritage to Barbados, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and Trinidad-Tobago. Findings in Chapter 2 suggest that racism is an enduring problem in the U.S. for both foreign and native-born Black Americans and that it cannot simply be dismissed as a worldview that serves to protect one’s sense of self-worth. Furthermore, it appears to be an obstacle for Caribbean Black Americans pursuing the American dream and may be associated with decreasing perceptions among Caribbean Black professionals that hard work and perseverance are all one needs to succeed in the U.S. I find in Chapter 3 that anger in response to increases in day-to-day discrimination is negatively associated with major depressive disorder for Caribbean Black Americans, while, for African Americans, anger is positively associated with major depressive disorder. In addition, while African Americans and second generation Caribbean Black Americans show no significant effects of religiousness items on depression, first generation Caribbeans benefit from religious organizational involvement. In contrast, their mental health is threatened by increasing emotional and tangible religious support. I discuss these findings as they relate to the historical legacy of racism in the Caribbean and the U.S., measurement issues surrounding depression, and the resources available to immigrants. In Chapter 4 I find limited support for the argument that discrimination will promote political involvement. Perceptions of discrimination against oneself are not significantly associated with increases in political participation. Surprisingly, individual-level discrimination and perceptions of group discrimination are not associated with Black advancement organization membership either. Perceiving no change in racial discrimination over the past 20 years, however, increases political participation (i.e., the probability that one will vote, participate in political campaigns, or contact political officials). Perceptions of group discrimination appear to be particularly alienating for second generation Caribbean Black Americans compared to African Americans. Second generation respondents’ political participation declines precipitously as perceived group discrimination increases. Finally, I find that Black advancement organization membership provides health benefits beyond political participation. This dissertation makes substantive and methodological contributions by examining diversity in the Black American population in predictors, resources, and health consequences of perceived discrimination and by modeling perceived discrimination to account for both increases in perceived discrimination and predictors of the likelihood that one will never report discrimination.","social research , clinical psychology , ethnic studies",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

This is particularly true for inter-ethnic attitudes. They are a consequence of an overt social influence but also of a subtle social tuning to specific social cues that determines desirability of expression of a particular attitude. When a community is fundamentally ethnically divided, other social cues may be of less importance. As a result of the recent war, the city of Vukovar (Croatia) turned into the divided community in which ethnic membership powerfully determines social interactions, including separated schooling. The present study assessed at two points in time six years apart a set of attitudes relevant for the context of current inter-ethnic relations: (1) attitudes towards school integration; (2) attitudes toward social integration of children outside the schools; (3) tolerance of multiculturalism; (4) attitudes toward assimilation of ethnic minorities. Two measures of behavioral intentions were also assessed: majority/minority contacts and tendency to discriminate against the outgroup. Besides the attitudinal change, we assessed congruence between children's and parental attitudes and analyzed if children's discrimination tendencies could be predicted by parental attitudes and discrimination tendencies. Two independent samples of school children of Croatian (majority) and Serbian (minority) ethnic background (N= 719 and N= 815) aged 12-16 and their parents participated in the study in 2001 and 2007. The results revealed small, but significantly more positive inter-ethnic attitudes, with changes in the majority being more prominent. The congruence of children and parental attitudes was higher in the majority in the first assessment, which decreased over time, probably reflecting the increased diversity of social and political influences affecting the majority.

The current study advances this goal by analyzing experiences with interpersonal racial discrimination. Existing research demonstrates that reports of such antagonistic encounters are widespread. This persistent interracial hostility may hinder the country’s adaptation to a more multi-racial reality. In three separate papers I consider the extent, correlates and consequences of interpersonal racial discrimination. The first paper examines how neighborhood racial composition can affect reports of discrimination. Using the Project for Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods and data from the U.S. Census, I analyze the discrimination experiences of black, Hispanic and white young adults. Results indicate different patterns across groups, which I characterize using the contact, group threat and ethnic density hypotheses. African Americans perceive the least discrimination in neighborhoods with few co-racial residents, following the contact hypothesis. Hispanics perceive the most discrimination in neighborhoods that are around half Hispanic and half non-Hispanic, following group threat theory. Finally, whites report decreasing discrimination levels as the neighborhood percentage white increases, following the ethnic density hypothesis. The causes and implications of these disparate patterns are discussed. The second paper examines whether experience with racial discrimination can perpetuate interracial hostility. I analyze how reported discrimination experiences are associated with negative racial attitudes among a sample of black, white and Hispanic adults from the Chicago Area Study. Further, I place such hostile experiences within one’s totality of interracial experiences by simultaneously considering positive contact experiences (interracial friendship) and interracial proximity (neighborhood and workplace contact). Through this approach, I present a more holistic understanding of real-world interracial contact. Multivariate results indicate three distinct patterns. The first occurs commonly among Hispanics and suggests that friendship contact mitigates the negative attitudinal consequences of discrimination. The second occurs occasionally among African Americans and suggests that friendship is beneficial only for those not experiencing discrimination. The final pattern, occurring among whites, suggests that the consequences of discrimination grow more extreme with greater interracial neighborhood contact. The final paper examines the understudied phenomenon of racial discrimination fear. I consider the extent and correlates of these fears among a sample of black and Hispanic adolescents from the final wave of the Project for Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. I lay the groundwork for a new line of inquiry focused on discrimination fears and develop hypotheses linking fear to direct discrimination experience, indirect experience and environmental signals. Results show discrimination fear to be common among minority adolescents and more prevalent than among their parents. Multivariate results indicate that fears are most likely when one has experienced discrimination directly. Indirect experience also predicts greater fear, suggesting that the consequences of discriminatory acts are not limited to the immediate victim. Finally, among African Americans, the presence of racial out-groups in one’s neighborhood acts as a signal for discrimination, resulting in greater fear.","african american studies , black studies , social psychology , ethnic studies , hispanic american studies",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Underlying this view is contact theory, which argues that increased contact between social groups will help reduce prejudicial attitudes and alleviate racial and ethnic divisions. This article tests and extends these propositions by examining the long-term impact of segregated and integrated education on political identities and attitudes. Using a pooled sample of surveys conducted on the adult population in Northern Ireland between 1998 and 2003, we address, for the first time, the question of whether or not experiencing a religiously integrated education has a significant effect on the political outlooks of Protestants and Catholics. The results suggest that attendance at a religiously integrated school--either one formally constituted as integrated or a religious school incorporating a proportion from the opposite religion--has positive long-term benefits in promoting a less sectarian stance on national identity and constitutional preferences. The results also support recent research that has shown that the impact of contact on intergroup relations may not only vary significantly in terms of the nature of the contact situation but also in terms of the societal status of the groups involved. We conclude that as the numbers experiencing integrated schooling grows, these individuals have the potential to create a new common ground in Northern Ireland politics.

More than three hundred years of de jure racial discrimination had ended. But many argue that the effects of these past policies continue to plague our society today, despite the fact that black people and white people tend to support the concept of racial equality. One of the mechanisms employed to ensure racial equality is affirmative action. Affirmative action policies are designed to redress the damage done by laws and policies that no longer exist. Many scholars, however, find white opposition to race-targeted policies is strong. Thus there is a paradox, white people support racial equality, and yet there is white resistance to racial policies designed to foster that equality. Where can policy makers take us next? Which Americans—black and white—support policy initiatives to address the effect of our historical mistakes? The scientific literature is currently unable to clarify this puzzle. There are four theories which help conceptualize racial attitudes. In this study, each theory is tested using multiple regression models. Unlike most previous studies, the attitudes of both blacks and whites are examined. These attitudes were collected from an in-home survey conducted in the last half of 1992. A total of 1,124 metropolitan Detroit area residents were interviewed in ninety-six separate neighborhoods. The most significant findings include: ideological opposition to affirmative action policies by both blacks and whites can be enough to make them oppose affirmative action policies; black people demonstrate some of the same antiblack stereotypes and attitudes as whites, thus clouding previous conceptions of white racism; motivations of self-interest only influence affirmative action policy positions among blacks, and only when individuals believe racial discrimination has affected their workplace success; and finally, close interracial contact is related to both blacks and whites increased opposition to affirmative action policies.","political science , minority & ethnic groups , sociology , african americans , american studies",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Three studies explored different questions related to friendship quality: how friendship quality develops, how friendship quality and friendship influences interact on risky behavior, and whether friendship quality acts as a protective factor against perceived racial discrimination on risky behavior. Girls reported higher friendship quality across all four time-points from 6 th to 10 th grades. Fewer gender differences were found in 10 th grade, which suggests a dosing of the gap later on in high school. Piecewise hierarchical linear models were conducted to examine the different rates of change before and after the high school transition. Girls' increasing friendship quality trajectories were found to level off from 9 th to 10 th grade. Boys continued to increase in friendship quality into 10 th grade. These findings highlight gender differences in the development of friendship quality. Regression analyses from the second study found marginally significant results for positive friendship quality. When the friendship was low in quality and the friend engaged in higher levels of risky behavior, girls were more likely to engage in risky behavior in 8 th grade. Additionally, when the friendship was high in quality and the friend engaged in higher levels of risky behavior, girls' risky behavior increased slightly from 6 th to 8 th grade. These results suggest that low friendship quality is more detrimental than high friendship quality when the girl's best friend is engaging in risky behavior. Regression analyses from the third study revealed significant findings in boys for the interaction between positive friendship quality and perceived discrimination. No significant findings were found for girls. For boys, positive friendship quality, guidance, and validation were found to protect against the negative effect of perceived discrimination on risky behavior. These results suggest that for boys, positive friendship quality is important in providing care and support when they are faced with racial discrimination. These findings highlight gender differences in the development of friendship quality and the benefits of friendships as well as socialization versus selection effects. Future research and preventative measures against risky behavior in African American adolescents are discussed.","african american studies , black studies , developmental psychology",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Early adolescents experience important shifts in their relationships with adults and peers, and have a growing capacity to perceive discrimination and understand ethnic-racial categories and stereotypes. Most research, however, does not explore these developmental phenomena during middle school, account for the source (peers, adults) and form (explicit, implicit) of ethnic-racial discrimination, or examine these processes using multiple methods. This longitudinal, mixed-methods dissertation (1) identifies developmental trajectory profiles of early adolescents' perceptions of ethnic-racial discrimination from peers and adults during middle school; (2) examines how they vary by ethnicity, gender, and immigrant status; (3) examines the psychological and social correlates of those trajectories; and (4) explores adolescents' descriptions of ethnic-racial discrimination. Participants are low-income Dominican- ( n = 156), Chinese- (n = 205), and African American (n = 224) adolescents attending urban public middle schools. Quantitative findings reveal that experiences of discrimination during middle school vary by form and source. Implicit discrimination from peers and adults displays low-stable and moderate-increasing clusters. Explicit adult discrimination displays low and moderate stable clusters. Explicit peer discrimination displays low, moderate, and high decreasing clusters. Importantly, ethnicity and gender are significantly associated with ethnic-racial discrimination trajectories. African Americans, Chinese-Americans, and boys are more likely to be members of trajectory clusters experiencing discrimination. Analyses also indicate the following associations between trajectory cluster membership and psychological and social adjustment in eighth grade: (1) moderate and high decreasing trajectories of explicit peer discrimination are negatively associated with self esteem; (2) moderate-stable explicit adult discrimination is negatively associated with depressive symptoms; (3) moderate-stable explicit adult discrimination is negatively associated with best friendship quality; (4) moderate-increasing implicit and moderate-stable explicit adult discrimination are negatively associated with teacher-student relationship quality; and (5) high-decreasing explicit peer discrimination is negatively associated with school belonging. The qualitative data reveal that adolescents perceive ethnic-racial discrimination as the enactment of ethnic and racial stereotypes. Further, those stereotypes determine the form, source, and content of discrimination.

While intergroup contact has received considerable attention in explaining ethnic threat, group relative deprivation (GRD), that is, feelings that one’s group is unfairly deprived of desirable goods in comparison to relevant out-groups, has been largely ignored in cross-national research. Nevertheless, various smaller-scale studies have demonstrated that GRD can have a decisive impact on prejudice. In the current study, we examine the association between GRD and ethnic threat systematically across 20 European countries, thereby controlling for intergroup contact and value priorities. The 7th round of the European Social Survey (ESS) includes questions assessing respondents’ feelings of group deprivation compared to immigrants and offers for the first time an opportunity to contextualise the threat-inducing effect of GRD across Europe. A multilevel structural equation model (MLSEM) demonstrates a considerable association between GRD and ethnic threat both on the individual and country levels. The results indicate that GRD is not only an important mediating factor between social structural positions and perceived threat, but also fully mediates the relation between contextual economic indicators and ethnic threat. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",ethnic threat; european social survey (ess); group relative deprivation (grd); intergroup contact; multilevel structural equation modelling (mlsem),Article,Article in Press,Scopus

First, a mediation model was utilized to examine the hypothesized path between teacher racial discrimination, academic goals, and school achievement – and the hypothesized path between peer racial discrimination, mental health, and school achievement. Second, moderated mediation was employed to examine the influence of parent educational advocacy on the hypothesized path between teacher racial discrimination, academic goals, and school achievement – and the influence of friendship support on the hypothesized path between peer racial discrimination, mental health, and school achievement. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to test all paths. Only mental health factors were found to mediate the relation between peer racial discrimination and school achievement for Black and Latino girls. However, moderated mediation revealed additional mediated paths that were not gender specific but were influenced by differing levels of the moderating variables. For instance, lower levels of parent educational advocacy were found to strengthen the negative impact of teacher racial discrimination on student achievement through mastery goals and performance-avoidance goals for Latino youth. Similarly, lower levels of friendship support were found to strengthen the negative impact of peer racial discrimination on student achievement through depressive symptoms for Black youth. These findings suggest that the absence of parent educational advocacy and friendship support in adverse situations can have negative psychological and academic consequences for both Black and Latino students. Implications of the findings for promoting parent educational advocacy and friendship support were discussed. Also discussed was the notion that mediation cannot always be understood alone and that differing levels of a moderator can more effectively explain a unique path.","educational sociology , educational psychology",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Positive intergroup contact with the dominant group (New Zealand Europeans) predicted increased opposition to a topical reparative policy (Maori ownership of the foreshore), and this was fully mediated by increased support for the ideology of meritocracy. Intergroup contact may enable the ideological legitimation of inequality among members of disadvantaged groups, engendering political attitudes that are detrimental to their group's interests. Contact with ingroup members had the opposite effect, increasing support for reparative policy by reducing subscription to meritocratic ideology.

Studies 1 and 2 tested the simultaneous effects of intergroup contact and established predictors of collective action on collective action tendencies and ingroup and outgroup oriented policies among Blacks and Whites in South Africa, and compared the effects of intergroup contact and social identity on collective action tendencies via relative deprivation and group efficacy. The findings revealed that while social identity was positively associated with collective action tendencies, both directly and indirectly, effects of contact were negative and indirect via relative deprivation and group efficacy. Studies 3 and 4 investigated the effects of contact and social identity on collective action tendencies via perceived threats. Using data from Turkish and Kurdish groups in Turkey, I found that social identity predicted collective action tendencies positively, both directly and indirectly, while it predicted outgroup attitudes negatively and indirectly via perceived threats. Intergroup contact, on the other hand, predicted outgroup attitudes positively, both directly and indirectly, and collective action tendencies negatively via perceived threats. In Study 5, intergroup contact was positively associated, both directly and indirectly, via perspective taking and collective guilt, associated with outgroup oriented collective action tendencies. In Study 6, the effect of social identity on ingroup oriented collective action was positive and direct. Intergroup contact with the weaker minority group, on the other hand, was positively associated with outgroup oriented collective action tendencies via perspective taking. Additionally, intergroup contact with the majority outgroup moderated this relationship. When participants reported more contact with the majority group, intergroup contact with the weaker minority was not associated with outgroup oriented collective action tendencies. However, when the participants reported less contact with the majority group, intergroup contact positively predicted outgroup oriented collective action tendencies. Finally, Study 7 investigated the effects of two different dimensions of contact, contact with the majority and minority on collective action, via outgroup attitudes, dual-identification, and common ingroup identity in a three wave longitudinal design (N=610) among Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus.

A sample of 132 low-income male and female adolescents, ages 13 to 18, is used. Roughly half (65) of these live in overwhelmingly white, middle-income suburban neighborhoods of East Yonkers thanks to a court-ordered housing mobility program. These ""movers"" have left behind the mostly non-white, high-poverty neighborhoods of Southwest Yonkers where the other 67 youth, a control group of ""stayers,"" still live. Regression and lowess scatterplot techniques are used to examine the structure, diversity, and supportiveness of the youth's social networks. These analyses provide a view of social isolation, and of mechanisms through which neighborhoods may affect youth, that are missing in previous research. Results indicate that movers have fewer neighborhood acquaintances but have found new hangouts and are no more cut off from close friends and relatives than are stayers. Few differences in network diversity or supports were found: movers appear to be somewhat more confident of receiving everyday favors from neighborhood adults. Few movers or stayers have significant ties to whites, and most of these are neighbors in public housing. Moreover, roughly half of the youth have no kin with a high school diploma, and most show more access to social support than ""leverage"" forms of social capital--good sources of job information, career advice, etc. Finally, Latino youth, especially those whose parents are foreign-born immigrants, have fewer and less well-placed contacts, spend less time with peers, and report less network support than do African-Americans. Results for delinquency show no important effects of moving but strongly confirm the importance of parent monitoring as an inhibitor of problem behavior.

Previous research on return intentions among economic migrants has pointed at the relevance of three aspects of integration: employment and education (structural integration), language proficiency (cultural integration) and contact with natives (social integration) in shaping the wish to stay or return. We examined whether this is also the case among refugees. Furthermore, we extended research on return intentions by considering two social psychological experiences—host country identification and perceived discrimination—as mediators in the associations between the three aspects of integration and return wishes. Using a large survey among refugees from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and Somalia in the Netherlands, we found that employment was not related to return wishes. Higher-educated refugees and those proficient in Dutch perceived more discrimination and were therefore more likely to want to return. Simultaneously, language proficiency was also related to a wish to stay via increased host country identification. Contacts with natives were related to less discrimination and more identification, and therefore to a wish to stay. We discuss the importance of social psychological experiences, and the cross pressures they exert on the return wishes of refugees. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",host national identification; integration; perceived discrimination; refugees; return wishes,Article,Final,Scopus

A mixed methods design was used, employing open-ended questions to obtain qualitative information about ways in which cross-ethnic friendships are formed. Questionnaires and measures were used to gather quantitative information about the number of cross-ethnic friendships, ethnic identity, perceived discrimination, depressive symptoms, physical symptoms, and attitudes toward racial/ethnic diversity. Having cross-ethnic friendships is significantly associated with lower ethnic identity and more accepting attitudes towards contact with racial/ethnic diversity. While perceived ethnic discrimination positively correlates with both depression and physical symptoms, no significant interaction is shown between cross-ethnic friendships and perceived discrimination.

Understanding the factors underlying the country's interracial attitudes is, consequently, important. Social identity theory suggests that Black African attitudes towards White people are connected to their evaluations of South Africa's other racial minorities. This thesis seems counterintuitive given that White people are associated with a long history of political, economic, and social oppression in the collective memory of many Black African communities. Nationally representative data from the South African Social Attitudes Survey were used to validate the thesis that Black Africans' evaluations of White people correlated with their assessments of other racial groups. Pairwise correlation analysis was employed to test the article's hypothesis. The results presented in this article showed that Black Africans' evaluations towards the White minority correlated with their evaluations of other racial minorities in South Africa. Multivariate analysis, specifically a standard (ordinary least squares) linear regression, was used to confirm the bivariate analysis. Black Africans' attitudes towards White people were strongly correlated with attitudes towards the country's two other major racial minorities. This finding held even controlling for contact with White people as well as a range of socio-economic characteristics. The outcomes of this article invite closer examination of the factors that underlie the generality of outgroup evaluations among South Africa's Black African majority.

The goal was to achieve a more complete understanding of expatriate cross-cultural adjustment by examining adjustment within a social context. Instruments utilized included Ong and Ward's (2005) Index of Sojourner Social Support (ISSS) Scale and Black and Stephens' (1989) scale for general adjustment. Results from this research indicate that the general adjustment of expatriates is significantly related to satisfaction with social contact with local nationals (r = .21, p < .05), socioemotional coping support ( r = -.24, p < .05), and instrumental coping support (r = .21, p < .05). A surprise finding of this research was the statistically significant correlation between reported frequency of social contact with other expatriates and perceived discrimination from other expatriates (r = -.21, p < .05). Overall, this study supports the emphasis on quality of social contacts over frequency of social contacts as a dimension of cross-cultural adjustment. However, since results also indicate the presence of expatriate in-group discrimination they may bring new questions for research that emphasizes the buffering role of the expatriate community on adjustment.

People with disabilities often experience discrimination and unequal treatment. Sometimes the mere categorization of people into groups, that is, ‘healthy’ vs. ‘disabled’, is enough to trigger discriminatory behaviour against people with disabilities. Previous studies show that in general disabilities depress political participation. However, the effect of disability-based discrimination on participation has received little scholarly attention. We study how perceptions of discrimination affect three forms of political participation: voting; contacting politicians; and participating in demonstrations. Results show that disability decreases voting, especially when associated with perceptions of discrimination. The analysis points in the opposite direction when the other two forms of political participation are analysed. People with disabilities are more likely to partake in demonstrations and contact politicians than non-disabled. Thus, disability-based discrimination is not always a hindrance to participation.

One hundred and three women completed a self-administered survey. The outreach was conducted at local conferences, nationally via the internet, and by word of mouth. The type of mentoring functions were assessed by using Noe's (1988) 29-item scale. Ethnic identity was assessed by using Phinney's (1992) Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure. Questions regarding mentor preference, professional success, and gender roles, as well as open-ended questions, were created by the researcher. Triangulation was used by reviewing academic journals, media clips such as news, magazine articles, and also by combining qualitative and quantitative approaches to the questionnaire. Findings did not support that stronger ethnic identity would influence a woman's willingness to decline a mentoring experience. On the contrary, the women in this study have been mentored at some level: received the psychosocial functions of mentoring, and/or reported up-to two people that supported them in their career. Overall, the ethnic identity profile of the women in this study was consistent with a bicultural identity allowing them to have a balance between their culture and to function in their work. The relationship between ethnic identity and preference to be mentored by someone of similar ethnicity was supported. Most of the women reported a female Latina as the most important person who supported them toward career advancement. They are relatively content with their current career status, and hold a positive outlook for their advancement. The Latina women in this study held different titles and positions within their organizations, and some have their own business. They almost unanimously expressed concern about discrimination in the workplace (i.e., gender, ethnic, and cultural) and experienced the challenge of balancing work and family. They recommended education, developing mentoring relationships and networks, and developing contacts outside of their ethnic culture as strategies for overcoming barriers.","minority & ethnic groups , sociology , womens studies , occupational psychology",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

This dissertation study represents a pioneering effort in investigating whether the post-9/11 backlash against Arabs and Muslims has penetrated community college campuses. The main objective of the study is to investigate the potential inter-relationships among the level of perceived discrimination, the degree of diversity of Arab and Muslim students' campus friendships, and their sense of belonging to the college. This study challenges the tenets of Allport's contact hypothesis and advances instead two conflict theories, integrated threat theory and social dominance theory that provide the theoretical framework for why perceived discrimination might promote ethnic and religious clustering among Arab and Muslim community college students. The study employs a mixed methods design, a 92-item survey, and three focus groups. The survey sample consists of 753 Arab Christian, Arab Muslim, and non-Arab Muslim students from 15 community colleges in Southern California and six community colleges in Southeast Michigan. The results of the study are as follows: (a) there is a positive relationship between Arab and Muslim students' campus friendships and the sense of belonging to the college; (b) there were no significant correlations between the level of perceived discrimination and the percentage of campus friends who were of the same ancestry and same religion, same ancestry and different religion, same religion and different ancestry, and different religion and different ancestry; (c) there was no relationship between strength of ethnic identity and the percentage of campus friends from the four ethnic/faith friendship groups; and, (d) there were no interactions between the strength of ethnic identity and the level of perceived discrimination on the dependent variables, sense of belonging and the percentage of campus friends from the four ethnic/faith friendship groups. Student focus groups furnished testimony on their experiences with discrimination on campus as well as provided insight into Arab and Muslim students' reluctance to report discrimination in surveys. The implications of the study are for community college researchers to tailor their measures of campus climate to fit specifically the institutional type and the student demographic profile. Campus climate measures must include items that not only draw out more subtle forms of discrimination, but also inquire into a wide scope and frequency of discriminatory behaviors.

International migration has risen exponentially in recent decades due to advances in technology and com munications. According to the International Organization for Migration (OIM, 2010), the estimated number of international migrants in the world for that year was 214 million, doubling the previous two decades. Globalization has promoted exchanges among different cultures, but also caused the collision between different value systems, beliefs and customs that, in many cases, generates situations of confusion or discomfort in people (Furnham & Bochner, 1986). Approxi mate ly 2.9 million people each year decide to make or complete their studies in other countries (OECD, 2008). Argentina receives an increasing number of students from other Latin-American countries, attracted by the language, the academic prestige of the local universities and the favorable economic conditions (Filmus, 2007). At the pre sent, international students represent 1.6% of university students in Argentina. Therefore, Argen tina is the fourth host country of America, after United States, Canada and Uruguay. As a result of intercultural contact, students go through the psychological process called acculturation, which involves affective, behavioral and cogni tive changes. Taking into account the antecedents mention ed, this research proposed to identify predictors of socio-cultural adaptation based on socio-demographic, cultural and psychological variables, in international students who decided to make their university studies in Argentina. The participants of the study were 216 migrant stu dents who were studying different careers. 57% were women (n = 124) and 43% males (n = 92) with an average age of 24.18 years (SD = 4.55). 86% (n = 186) were born in Latin-Ame rica. The remaining 14% came from Europe and Asia. The average residence time in Argentina was 3.31 years. The reasons for their arrival in Argentina were diverse, 50% (n = 108) of them considered that Argentina was a good place to study for its academic prestige and low costs. The remaining half was divided between family reasons (n = 47, 21%), to have a different cultural experi ence (n = 30, 14%), for student exchange (n = 19, 9%) or others reasons (n = 13, 6%). Regarding socio-economic status, the majority of respondents said they were in the middle class (n = 107, 50%) and upper middle (n = 82, 38%). Different instruments, designed ad hoc or adapted, were used to measure the variables involved in the study. To measure cultural variables were used instruments to assess perceived cultural distance, frequency of contact with foreigners and local habitants, intergroup anxiety and perceived discrimination. To measure psychological varia bles, were used instruments to assess social support and life satisfaction. Besides, were used instruments to assess the level of sociocultural adaptation. Based on results obtained, it could not be verified influence by socio-demograph ic varia bles (age and residence time). In contrast, among the cultural variables it was found that low levels of perceived discrimination an inter-grupal anxiety predicts good levels of sociocultural adaptation. Regarding psychol ogical varia bles, it was confirm ed that social support and perceived satisfaction contribute to this adaptation. In summary, cultural and psy chological variables predict most success ful socio-cultural adaptation than socio-demograph ic variables. One of the limitations of the study was the low inclusion in the sample of immigrants from countries with greater cultural distance. Futures studies can focuses on the anal ysis of the processes of adaptation with foreign students with language and customs more distant than Latin-American students. Other future re search can study the percep tions of those who receive foreign students (host country) and analyze their relation ship and influence on the perception of discrimination and prejudice from immigrants.",discrimination; intergrupal anxiety; international students; predictors; social suppor; socio-cultural adaptation,Article,Final,Scopus

A gender analysis,Brain Sciences,8,8,NA,NA,10.3390/brainsci8080140,"Recent research has documented poor mental health among high socioeconomic status (SES) Blacks, particularly African American males. The literature has also shown a positive link between SES and perceived discrimination, suggesting that perceived discrimination may explain why high SES Black males report poor mental health. To better understand the role of contextual factors in explaining this pattern, we aimed to test whether school racial composition explains why high income Black youth perceive more discrimination. We explored these associations by ethnicity and gender. Using data from the National Survey of American Life-Adolescent supplement (NSAL-A), the current study included 810 African American and 360 Caribbean Black youth, with a mean age of 15. Ethnicity, age, gender, income-to-needs ratio (SES), skin color, school racial composition, and perceived (daily) discrimination were measured. Using Stata 15.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA), we fitted seven structural equation models (SEMs) for data analysis in the pooled sample based on the intersection of ethnicity and gender. Considerable gender by ethnicity variations were found in the associations between SES, school racial composition, and perceived discrimination. For African American males but not African American females or Caribbean Black males or females, school racial composition fully mediated the effect of SES on perceived discrimination. The role of inter-racial contact as a mechanism for high discrimination and poor mental health of Black American adolescents may depend on their intersection of ethnicity and gender. School racial composition may be a mechanism for increased perceived discrimination among high SES African American males. © 2018 by the authors.

In many countries, mass publics have increasingly become intolerant of ethnic minorities and dissatisfied with their governments' responses to immigration. As I argue in this dissertation, public opposition to immigration reflects a general societal problem: intergroup tensions based on race or ethnicity. Public attitudes toward immigration therefore can be studied within the broader context of ingroup-outgroup relations. Drawing from contemporary theoretical approaches to whites' racial policy attitudes in the U.S., I develop an analytical framework that integrates these theoretical perspectives to explain Western Europeans' immigration policy preferences. Specifically, my theoretical model accounts for the effects of ethnic prejudice, perceived realistic group conflict, and political orientations (i.e., political values and ideology) on these policy attitudes. Using a structural equation modeling approach based on Eurobarometer No. 30 (1988) survey data, I analyze public opposition to pro-immigrant policies in four Western European countries--France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Great Britain. Results indicate that although the influence of ethnic prejudice and political orientations cannot be completely discounted in the context of immigration policy attitudes in Western Europe, perceptions of group conflict between nationals and immigrants are the most important determinant of the publics' anti-immigration policy preferences. Intergroup conflict, however, is highly contextual. In this respect, realistic group conflict theorists assume that individuals' beliefs reflect their social and economic environment. I test this proposition via a multi-level analysis examining how objective conditions of group conflict relate to perceived conflict. The respective findings, yielded by regression analysis, suggest that subjectively experienced group conflict reflects a complex mix of contextual factors: intergroup contact, one's socioeconomic context, and the influence of the national ethnic and economic environment. The dissertation concludes with a discussion of the broader implications of these findings for the study of ingroup-outgroup politics beyond the American context.

The present study adopts an ecological approach to investigate how refugees perceive the welcoming climate in Germany and the consequences of this perception. To further explore the refugees' situation, we examined several predictors of their psychological adjustment and acculturation attitudes. In a field study in Eastern Germany with N = 94 refugees as participants, we assessed the perceived context of reception, and perceived acculturation attitudes as contextual variables, discrimination and contact as intergroup variables and, on the individual level, psychological adjustment as well as the personal acculturation attitudes as dependent variables. The results revealed that more perceived discrimination resulted in an increase in reported psychological problems. Refugees living in asylum centers reported more psychological problems and more perceived discrimination than those living in independent housing. The perceived context of reception positively predicted refugees' desire for maintenance of intergroup relations with the host society. Positive intergroup contact lowered their desire for cultural maintenance. In sum, this study gives us rare and valuable insight into refugees' perspectives in the context of recent immigration to Germany. In doing so, it emphasizes the importance of a welcoming climate. The study shows how meaningful the assessment of the perceived context of reception is. Practical implications for fields such as the accommodation of refugees are discussed.

This article considers this possibility by examining the link between interpersonal discrimination and racial attitudes. Further, I situate discrimination into one’s totality of interracial exposure by analyzing whether other forms of interracial contact (friends, neighbors, or coworkers) condition the discrimination–attitudes association. Using representative data from the Chicago Area Study, I find that black, Hispanic, and white adults express greater feelings of racial threat and ingroup closeness when they report discrimination. The conditional effects vary across race/ethnicity. Among Hispanics, friendship mitigates these attitudinal consequences. For blacks, friendship is beneficial only for those not experiencing discrimination. Among whites, discrimination’s attitudinal consequences grow more extreme with greater neighborhood contact. Overall, the results suggest that (1) racial attitudes should be added to the list of interpersonal racial discrimination consequences and (2) discrimination is often a primary form of contact contributing to the development of racial attitudes. © 2017 North Central Sociological Association.",NA,Article,Final,Scopus

The questions for investigation were: Given various backgrounds and experiences in school, how do Eastern, Western and Mixed descent high school children express: (1) Their attitudes toward self and other groups. (2) Their beliefs concerning interethnic relations (e.g., intermarriage, friendship, and leadership). (3) Personal self-esteem. The method involved a survey of 861 Jewish high school pupils from Eastern, Western, and Mixed parentage. The students were from 31 classes in 12 integrated and nonintegrated high schools from 12 cities in Israel. Gathering data from students was done by means of questionnaires, constructed to this end and distributed and filled out in the classroom during class time. The independent variables included ethnic descent and low, moderate and high levels of school ethnic integration from high Eastern to high Western. The dependent variables were based on an original, validated student interethnic attitude and self-esteem questionnaire which produced six significant factors: (1) Acceptance of segregation. (2) Openness to integration. (3) Solidarity with one's own group. (4) Negative Eastern stereotyping. (5) General stereotyping. (6) Perception of ethnic deprivation. The results showed that school integration had a significant, positive impact on attitudes (integrated schools created more openness and tolerance). Further, children of mixed parents were most tolerant and had least negative stereotyping. Eastern Jewish children were more accepting than Western. The results of the self-esteem questionnaire were inconclusive and, contrary to expectation, no differences were found for self-esteem attitudes between Eastern and Western students whether in the majority or minority. The results of this study shed light on the issues of integration. They emphasize the importance of interethnic contact in the schools for improving students' attitudes towards each other and for achieving positive results in the efforts toward integration. Thus, the findings may contribute to constructive policies of interethnic relations in the educational system. Israeli schools, therefore, have a timely opportunity to break down divisive attitudes and stereotypes (while maintaining self-esteem) and to contribute to the unity of Israeli life.","educational sociology , bilingual education , multicultural education",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Results found FH, in general, to be more pronounced in the Russian Jewish sample, and acculturation orientation and language use predicted interindividual differences in FH in both samples.

This study views failure and problems experienced by the sojourner as a result of lack of the necessary new social skills and knowledge. Social networks, particularly friendships, are thus extremely important in that such networks are not only source of social support, but also major channels through which such skills and knowledge are acquired. Guided by social support theories and social skills theories, this study examines the following research questions through the survey and the interview with a sample of Chinese students at Northwest University I and five other universities across the United States. (1) How is adjustment of Chinese students related to their friendship patterns? (2) What are the friendship patterns of Chinese students? (3) What are the primary functions of the friendship patterns of Chinese students? (4) How is the degree of difficulty felt by Chinese students in different social situations related to their friendship patterns? (5) How is social adjustment related to the degree of difficulty felt by Chinese students in different social situations? Some additional questions related to the five research questions were also addressed in this study. The study showed there were different functions for different friendship patterns among Chinese students. Despite different functions, friendships are very important for Chinese in their adjustment to the United States. However, students belonging to the bi-cultural friendship pattern were more satisfied with social as well as academic aspects of their life in this country than those who belong to the mono-cultural friendship pattern.

This thesis extends current knowledge on cross-ethnic friendships by examining the prevalence and effects of such friendships on various developmental outcomes among ethnic majority and minority status children attending multiethnic schools. While Chapter 1 presented an overview of the literature on cross-ethnic friendships, following empirical chapters (Chapters 2-6) demonstrated findings from a comprehensive 3-wave school study conducted in London schools. Chapter 2 focused on patterns of cross-ethnic friendships and showed specific relationships between ethnic diversity, ethnic group and cross-ethnic friendships. Chapter 3 indicated that cross-ethnic friendships are related to positive outcomes such as psychological well-being, resilience and academic outcomes and moderate the negative effects of discrimination. Chapter 4 showed that interpersonal processes of self-disclosure and ideal self affirmation mediated the associations between cross-ethnic friendships and well-being measures. Chapter 5 examined anxiety and intimate self-disclosure in both same- and cross-ethnic friendships and indicated that reduced anxiety is a unique process whereby cross-ethnic friendships relate to positive outcomes. Chapter 6 revealed longitudinal associations between cross-ethnic friendships and positive outcomes and showed that these associations are stronger in classrooms with lower classroom racial tension. Finally, Chapter 7 investigated cross-ethnic friendships in the light of motivational outcomes; results of two experimental studies indicated that mental representations of cross-ethnic friendships may have effects on future career and academic choices of ethnic minority young adolescents. Overall, findings show that cross-ethnic friendships are important resources for children, providing benefits for the development of psychological, academic and motivational outcomes among children. The role of cross-ethnic friendships on positive development is discussed in the light of ethnic group differences and implications for school policies in multiethnic settings (Chapter 8).",no umi subject assigned,Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Le contact inter-groupes positif peut nuire a l'engagement des membres d'un groupe defavorise envers l'action collective. Toutefois, nous formulons l'hypothese que le contact inter-groupes positif ou un membre du groupe favorise communique expressement son opposition a l'egard de l'inegalite entre les groupes (<< contact de soutien ) ne nuirait pas a l'action collective, voire agirait comme un stimulant parmi les membres du groupe defavorise. L'Etude 1 portait sur le contact inter-groupes entre des etudiants internationaux et des etudiants du pays dans une universite d'Australie. L'Etude 2 portait sur des immigrants au Canada ayant un contact inter-groupes avec une personne nee au Canada. Les resultats ont revele que le contact de soutien a fait augmenter l'engagement a l'egard de l'action collective, comparativement a diverses autres conditions comportant d'autres formes de contact inter-groupes positif. Il est apparu que l'accroissement du nombre d'injustices percues agit en tant que mediateur cle dans la relation entre le contact de soutien et l'engagement accru envers l'action collective.

With a few exceptions, the children felt that their schools respected their religious practices and other customs. Most children of minority backgrounds had mixed friendship groups and the range of achievements, experiences and attitudes in relation to school were largely unrelated to ethnic background. Hardly any young people saw teachers as overtly racist, though small numbers believed teachers discriminated in favour of other groups.

The data base for the study is the 1979 Chicano Survey conducted through the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. Nine hundred and ninety one interviews were completed for the 1979 Chicano Survey. This study, however, focused on the 429 respondents who were born in the United States and chose to take the interview in English. The subsample was selected because intergroup contact experiences are largely determined by English ability, and previous findings have concluded that exposure to dominant ideology and political attitudes are affected by nativity. Hence, both language and nativity were considered crucial factors for contact and political consciousness. The results indicate that the different contact experiences are associated with different views of self. Respondents who reported extensive ingroup contact were most likely to identify explicitly as oppressed group members (farmworkers, poor, blue collar workers, immigrants, Chicanos, Mestizos, Raza). Those who reported extensive anglo contact put forth an assimilated view of self, identifying as Americans, English speakers, middle class, Latinos, and Hispanics. People who reported extensive minority outgroup contact identified with the group on a broader level, as Chicanos, Mestizos, Indians, as well as Latinos, Hispanics, and as brown. Social contact was also related to political attitudes about the group's status in society. People who reported extensive ingroup contact were most politically aware about power differentials in society, systemic barriers to group mobility, and the discrimination faced by people of Mexican descent. They were also most likely to support social change. Conversely, people who reported the most contact with Anglos were least likely to acknowledge group subordination and support social change. Minority outgroup contact had a minimal effect on political attitudes as these respondents expressed support for traditional social change methods. In summary, the results indicate that group contact is an important social variable in the formation of self and political consciousness.",social psychology,Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

How do these impacts differ among whites, Blacks and Latinos? While existing literature sends the message that all types of contact with the system leads to political withdrawal, I argue that understanding the criminal justice system as systemically unjust can mobilize people to action. A sense of systemic injustice is the belief that negative experiences with the system are a result of unfair targeting by criminal justice policy due to group affiliation. Race conditions the paths by which individuals arrive at a sense of injustice, where whites understand negative experiences through the lens of class and Blacks and Latinos leverage race-based narratives. Drawing on five survey datasets I find support for the claim that when efficacy remains intact, a sense of injustice that arises from criminal justice experiences catalyzes political action. Fifty-nine in-depth interviews illustrate the process politicization resulting from contact across racial subgroups. Importantly, this dissertation expands on the racialized nature of law enforcement through a focus on Latinos, increasingly targeted for reasons related to immigration.","african american studies , black studies , political science , criminology , hispanic american studies",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Across both samples, negative contact with White Americans predicted greater collective action, largely through the mechanisms of perceived discrimination and intergroup anger. Simultaneously, positive contact showed a negative indirect effect on collective action primarily through reduced anger.

Accordingly, the last decade has seen much research that has examined ways in which racial and ethnic diversity on college campuses can be defined, theorized, measured, and assessed, all with the intent of advancing our understanding of the educational benefits of diversity. Nonetheless, many questions remain unexplored, and the increasing level of scrutiny on the educational benefits of diversity suggests the need for even more compelling and refined empirical evidence. The present study sought to respond to this empirical need by examining a critical area that remains under-researched in the diversity debate, namely, researching the effects of students' pre-college experiences and pre-college racial environments on college diversity outcomes. Understanding students' pre-college experiences with diversity can serve to illuminate relationships that may have been under-estimated in prior diversity research. If the main effects of pre-college measures on students' diversity outcomes have been systematically under-examined, this suggests that the true educational benefits for students are in fact stronger and more compelling than have been established. This study's main conclusion is two-fold: students' pre-college racial environments and experiences do have notable perpetuation effects on college diversity outcomes such as cross-racial interactions and students' attitudes about racial discrimination; nonetheless, the multivariate results unmistakably show that racially and ethnically diverse college settings as well as students' college diversity experiences serve to significantly mediate or interrupt these perpetuation effects. In spite of students' segregated pre-college environments and experiences, public universities that are more structurally diverse and that foster more diverse curricular and co-curricular activities can positively affect students' levels of interactions with diverse peers as well as complicate their attitudes about racial discrimination in our society. These findings have implications both for K-12 desegregation efforts as well as for the policy debate on affirmative action in higher education.","higher education , minority & ethnic groups , sociology",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Instead, the effect of contact quality at T1 on national identification and out-group attitudes at T2 was indirect via perceived discrimination and out-group rejection at T2. In addition, there were two indirect pathways from out-group attitudes at T1 to national identification and outgroup attitudes at T2, via pleasant contact experiences (further associated with positive out-group attitudes) and via perceived discrimination (further associated with negative attitudes and lower national identification) in the post-migration stage. Anticipated discrimination only had a direct effect on out-group attitudes in the post-migration stage.

These studies question if those with less power show reductions in prejudice due to their needs for social justice being subsumed by the majority group's needs and desires (Nadler & Shnabel, 2008; Saguy, Pratto, Dovidio, & Nadler, 2009; Tausch & Becker, 2012). If so, surface level prejudice reduction may not represent reconciliation. As this critique hinges on psycho-social identity change, this dissertation investigates social identity change within two inter-group contact programs. Two cases are studied: NewGround: A Muslim-Jewish Partnership for Change and The Olive Tree Initiative (OTI). Both of these programs bring Jews and Muslims together in facilitated dialogue within the United States, where both groups are religious minorities. NewGround is located in Los Angeles and brings adults together over a period of months in a series of facilitated dialogues. OTI works with college-age students from mainly CA universities. OTI includes both educational sessions and a trip to the Middle East. A mixed-methods data gathering and analysis approach, including surveys and interviews, is used in this dissertation. The data set was collected from 2010 to 2014 longitudinally, with pre-program and post-program interviews and surveys by cohort. The resulting data set was analyzed in a longitudinal paired-sample design to understand how each individual changed over the course of the programs studied. Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis was used to analyze the interview data. This analysis demonstrated that participants saw identity as a key theme in their experience of inter-group contact. The dissertation later looks more specifically at two key identity-based variables within the survey data set. Statistical analysis shows significant positive changes in identification with both the original in-group and out-group, and similar changes in self-perceptions of efficacy, for participants of both the NewGround and Olive Tree Initiative programs. Further, gender moderates these results. Men in both programs demonstrated significant positive changes and, in most cases, lower starting values, in identification with the other. Conversely, women demonstrated significant positive changes including, in most cases, lower starting values on self-efficacy measures and then higher degrees of positive change in that dimension. Implications for the findings and future work are discussed, including how these findings inform literature on the role of women in peace building and future work examining long-term post-program retention of social-identity-based psychological changes and their political results.

Addressing this question, this research investigates how positive contact with members of the advantaged group shapes action strategies to cope with disadvantage. Using survey data from a sample of Latino Americans (N = 112), structural equation modeling revealed that friendship contact with Anglo-Whites was overall negatively associated with interest in collective action. This relation was due to both reduced identification with the disadvantaged group and positive attitudes toward the advantaged group, which predicted reduced anger about inequality. Contact was also positively associated with an individual mobility orientation, a relation which was explained through increased perceived permeability. Individual mobility orientation did not, however, predict reduced motivation for collective action. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings for societal change and novel directions for future research are discussed.

Despite increasing numbers of refugees and immigrants entering Norway in recent years, little is known about the relationship between immigrants’ different social identities and their feeling of integration into Norwegian society. The main goal of the present research is to fill this gap by investigating whether relationships found in other European countries replicate in the Norwegian context. In line with theoretical considerations and earlier international findings, results from two studies with different immigrant groups (Study 1: high school students; N = 97; Study 2: university students; N = 93) show that the more young immigrants in Norway endorse their national (i.e., Norwegian) identity, the less they endorse their ethnic identity (e.g., Kurdish). We further show that perceived conflict between the two cultures cannot explain the negative relationship between national and ethnic identity. In addition, immigrants’ national identity endorsement is positively related to their dual identity endorsement (e.g., Kurdish-Norwegian). Positive contact with members of the receiving society predicts young immigrants’ feeling of being integrated in Norwegian society and this relationship is mediated by national identity. Results are discussed in terms of the crucial role social identities play in immigrants’ feeling of integration into European societies. © 2019 The Authors.

We propose that one method of facilitating improved intergroup attitudes, a sense of community, and collective action intentions is Forum Theater (Boal, 1989); we tested this prediction in postwar Liberia. In 2 communities, 218 diverse Liberians participated in a field experiment evaluating 2 Forum Theater plays (one about rebuilding trust following intergroup conflict and one about a public health issue); we also included a control group that did not receive any intervention. Both Forum Theater interventions increased participants' sense of community and willingness to engage in collective action. Only the play about intergroup conflict increased intergroup trust and reduced social distance toward a disliked group. Specifically tailored Forum Theater thus has the potential to improve intergroup attitudes, sense of community, and collective action intentions in postconflict societies.

Public Significance Statement: In a postwar society, the community intervention method of Forum Theater strengthened participants' connection to their community and motivated them to collectively create change. When the content of the interactive intervention was tailored to address (rather than avoid) conflict between groups, participants' attitudes toward rival groups improved, such as becoming more trusting.

SDO captures an individual's ideological support for inequality. If contact is going to promote collective action to reduce inequality among the advantaged group, it must be expected to influence their ideological beliefs about hierarchy. In Study 1, only positive, and not negative contact was found to be associated with Whites' support for the Black Lives Matter movement, mediated by reductions in SDO. In Study 2, both positive and negative contact were associated, respectively, with more or less support for collective action to protect the rights of European immigrants during Brexit negotiations. While positive contact was associated with reduced SDO and more support for collective action among British nationals, negative contact was associated with increased SDO and lower support for collective action.

While intergroup contact has received considerable attention in explaining ethnic threat, group relative deprivation (GRD), that is, feelings that one’s group is unfairly deprived of desirable goods in comparison to relevant out-groups, has been largely ignored in cross-national research. Nevertheless, various smaller-scale studies have demonstrated that GRD can have a decisive impact on prejudice. In the current study, we examine the association between GRD and ethnic threat systematically across 20 European countries, thereby controlling for intergroup contact and value priorities.

A multilevel structural equation model (MLSEM) demonstrates a considerable association between GRD and ethnic threat both on the individual and country levels.

The current research aimed to test imagined contact effects on minority group members' acculturation strategies (contact participation and culture maintenance), perceived discrimination, feelings of belongingness, and social acceptance across three studies conducted in the United Kingdom (Study 1) and Turkey (Studies 2 and 3). Method: The sample consisted of Eastern Europeans in Study 1 (N = 63) and Kurds in Study 2 and 3 (N = 66 and 210, respectively). Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions (control vs. imagined contact) and completed measures of acculturation, perceived discrimination, general belongingness, and social acceptance. Results: Findings showed that while imagined contact significantly reduced perceived discrimination and culture maintenance, and increased contact participation and social acceptance among Eastern Europeans (Study 1), it reduced social acceptance and contact participation among Kurds recruited from a conflict-ridden homogeneous setting (Study 2). With a larger and more heterogeneous sample of Kurds (Study 3), these effects occurred only among those with higher ingroup identification. Moreover, in all studies social acceptance mediated the effects of imagined contact on contact participation and perceived discrimination. Discussion.

While much is known about the determinants of inflammation, there is currently little information regarding the causes of variation in the functioning of TP53, even though it has been recognized for 40 years as the most potent of the cancer suppressor genes. The current paper explores the interrelationship between these two biomarkers and investigates the extent to which they are influenced by the social environment. Methods: Using structural equation modeling (SEM) and longitudinal observational data from a sample of several hundred African Americans, we tested the hypothesis that adversity – operationalized as racial discrimination- and coping resources – operationalized as religiosity and black friends - influence expression of TP53, for better or worse, through their impact on inflammation. Results: Correlational analysis showed inflammation and TP53 to be inversely related. Further, discrimination was positively related to inflammation and negatively related to TP53 expression, whereas religiosity and black friends were both negatively related to inflammation and positively related to TP53 expression. Finally, SEM indicated that the effect of the social environmental variables on TP53 expression was indirect through level of inflammation. Conclusions: In addition to its established contribution to cancer through DNA damage and cell proliferation, inflammation likely increases cancer risk indirectly by inhibiting expression of the TP53 cancer suppressor gene. Hence environmental and stress management interventions may do more than reduce inflammation's cell damaging effects; they may also lessen the chances of cancer by increasing expression of TP53. © 2019",NA,Article,Final,Scopus

The results showed a significantly negative mediating effect of linking social capital with a negative association between subjective relative deprivation and life satisfaction. Moreover, the number of friends moderated the effect of linking social capital on life satisfaction. This study confirmed a moderated mediation model and highlighted the importance of linking social capital and subjective relative deprivation in deciding life satisfaction of Chinese rural-to-urban migrant workers. Polities and purposeful action for enhancing social integration (i.e., interaction with community members and taking part in social and political activities) are advised to build a well-off society in China. © 2020 by the authors.

We recruited 163 Syrian refugees (Mage = 36.43, SD = 12.68; 88 females and 75 males) from a south-eastern city in Turkey. PD was negatively associated with desire for culture maintenance and positively associated with desire for contact, indicating an assimilation trend as a response to PD. Both acculturation orientations in turn predicted well-being positively. However, the ones with higher group efficacy did not experience the detrimental effects of PD on well-being and indicated a stronger desire for contacting mainstream society. Further conditional indirect effects demonstrated that only among the ones with lower group efficacy, PD was related to lower psychological well-being through reduced culture maintenance. Findings indicate the critical role of group efficacy beliefs in the understanding of disadvantaged group members' reactions to PD.

Method: Our sample comprised 1,975 6th graders (Mage = 11.53, SDage = 0.69, 47% female) in Germany, of whom 1,213 (61%) were of immigrant background, defined as having at least 1 parent born in a different country. A total of 83 countries of origin were represented. We applied a multilevel framework to assess the impact of individual-level and class-level predictors on intergroup outcomes, controlling for the classroom ethnic composition, school track, and individual-level covariates. Immigrant background was treated as a moderator. Results: The 2 types of cultural diversity norms were generally associated with more positive intergroup outcomes. Some of the associations differed in strength between students of immigrant and nonimmigrant background. There were stronger associations of equality/inclusion with higher outgroup orientation among students of nonimmigrant background and with lower perceived discrimination among students of immigrant background. Ethnic composition, as well as the classroomaggregated diversity norms (diversity climate) showed weaker relations with the outcome variables. Conclusions: Equality/inclusion norms and cultural pluralism norms can make complementary contributions to positive relations between students of immigrant and nonimmigrant background. Equality/ inclusion norms foster positive contact and equal treatment, while cultural pluralism norms emphasize that it is also important to value diversity.1. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",cultural diversity; cultural pluralism; equality; intergroup relations; multiethnic classrooms,Article,Final,Scopus

Evidence from four European countries,Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,46,1,260,276,10.1080/1369183X.2019.1578203,"An important public debate in contemporary Europe is whether immigrant-origin Muslims will successfully integrate into mainstream society. We engage those debates by analysing national identification among immigrant-origin Muslim adolescents in England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden. A common argument is that the Islamic religion prevents Muslims from integrating because its practices are incompatible with mainstream European culture. However, we find that religiosity is not the most important predictor of Muslim identification. Instead, citizenship, contact with the native majority, and perceived discrimination are all as important as religiosity for predicting Muslim national identification. In addition, we find the same relationships between these variables and national identification among Muslim and non-Muslim immigrant-origin adolescents. Country of birth, host language proficiency, and socio-economic status, by contrast, are less important predictors of national identification of both groups. In sum, our findings suggest that Muslims are not necessarily a uniquely problematic population, as their national identification is best understood through dynamics that affect immigrants more broadly rather than Muslims specifically, though more research is necessary to identify specific causal pathways. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",integration; muslims; national identification,Article,Final,Scopus

To extend previous studies, we added perception of threat and intergroup contact to the model. A correlational study using 66 terrorism detainees in Indonesia as participants found solid support for our expanded EMSICA. The models extending EMSICA with perception of threat and quantity of contact as predictors had improved fit indices and explained more variance in the dependent variable support for Islamist terrorism, as compared to the standard model.

Absent from the literature is systematic examination of whether these constructs may be measured equivalently for adolescents from different ethnic-racial groups living in different contexts. In 2 large ethno-racially diverse samples of high school students in the Southwestern (N = 2,136) and Midwestern (N = 1,055) United States, the current study tested invariance of 4 widely used measures, including Adolescent Discrimination Distress Index (Fisher, Wallace, & Fenton, 2000), Ethnic Identity Scale-Brief (Douglass & Umana-Taylor, 2015), Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity-Teen (Scottham, Sellers, & Nguyen, 2008), and Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure-Other Group Orientation (Phinney, 1992). Results from multigroup confirmatory factor analyses supported configural and metric but not scalar invariance across Asian, Black, Latinx, Native, and White American adolescents, and across geographic regions for Asian, Black, and White American adolescents. Results demonstrate the utility of these measures to examine whether associations with theoretically related constructs differ across groups and regions, but specific items preclude mean-level group difference tests for certain groups. Supporting convergent validity across ethno-racially diverse adolescents in 2 regions, scores on ethnic-racial discrimination from peers, adults in school, and other adults in society were each positively associated with depressive symptoms; ERI exploration, resolution, affirmation, centrality, and public regard scores were each positively associated with self-esteem; and other group orientation scores were positively associated with ERI achievement.

Public Significance Statement-This study examined whether widely used measures of ethnic-racial discrimination and ethnic-racial identity (ERI) were equivalent (i.e., assessed similar constructs) for adolescents from different ethnic-racial groups and for adolescents from the same groups across different geographic regions. Results indicated measures assessed similar components of these constructs and can be used to test associations with other constructs for Asian, Black, Latinx, Native, and White American adolescents in the Midwestern and Southwestern United States, but some item-response levels were nonequivalent across certain groups.

The Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population experience significant disadvantage and adversity relative to the non-Aboriginal population, with disproportionate and increasing rates of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care and substantiated child maltreatment seven times the rates for non-Aboriginal children. Despite decades of resilience research there remains a gap in our understanding of the extent to which specific mechanisms and processes support resilient outcomes. This discussion paper synthesizes findings from our four previously published studies which together illustrate the application of a person-based resilience framework of analysis in the context of Western Australian Aboriginal youth. We discuss the implications of this approach for better understanding processes differentially impacting psychosocial functioning of youth depending on level of family-risk exposure. Data for these studies were available for 1021 Aboriginal youth, 12–17 years, drawn from the 2000–2002 Western Australian Aboriginal Child Health Survey (WAACHS), a population representative survey of 5289 Aboriginal children (0–17 years) living in 1999 families. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to model the differential influence of individual, family, cultural and community factors on psychosocial outcomes depending on family-risk context. Key findings revealed 56% of high-risk youth as psychosocially resilient; prosocial friendship and living in low SES neighborhoods uniquely protected psychosocial functioning; and exposure to racism was an additional risk factor for low-risk exposed youth. We conclude that a resilience perspective holds potential for exploring diversity within disadvantaged populations, identifying processes uniquely beneficial for those at greatest risk, and provides crucial insights for communities, practitioners and policy-makers. © 2017",child protection; family violence; indigenous; psychosocial; resilience; youth,Note,Final,Scopus

Results indicated that deliberative contact with a minority group member during small-group discussions increased support for policies that were beneficial to the minority group. This effect of deliberative contact was marginally stronger among those who had more negative contact experiences with the minority group in the past. Furthermore, deliberative contact effects were mediated by altered perceptions about the minority group's structural disadvantages in society, but not by an increase in factual knowledge about the outgroup.

Although prior research has identified intergroup harmony and justice as two distinct approaches to intergroup contact, little is known about whether online dialogue would foster a harmony- or justiceoriented discourse around conflict. To examine this question, the present study implemented a pre-post within-subjects design around a 4-week online dialogue intervention with Bosniaks and Serbs in the postconflict context of former Yugoslavia. Analyses of pre-post surveys suggest that the dialogue may have fostered a justice-oriented discourse among both Bosniaks and Serbs, who showed greater group identification and demands for justice after the dialogue compared to before the dialogue. There was also lower support for the goal of improving relationships and higher prioritization of discussions of justice after the dialogue. Exploring the linguistic content of the dialogue during the 4-week intervention further revealed that expressions of anger and anxiety decreased, whereas time orientations toward the present increased over time, suggesting that the justice-focused dialogue was not necessarily accompanied by explicit hostility over past atrocities. These findings help inform future interventions in postconflict societies, especially the use of online platforms to shape the discourse of conflict. © 2019 American Psychological Association.",intergroup conflict; intergroup dialogue; intervention; justice; online communication,Article,Final,Scopus

Similarly, social identity theory has identified the conditions that lead individuals to challenge unequal social systems. Integrating these two major theories, the current study examined the processes underlying the relationship between intergroup contact and participants’ willingness to engage in collective action to challenge social inequality. Specifically, we tested sociostructural variables (status legitimacy and stability, and permeability of group boundaries) as potential mediators of contact in a sample of both advantaged (Italian high school students, N = 392) and disadvantaged (immigrant high school students, N = 165) group members. We found that contact was positively associated with motivation for change, an effect mediated by decreased perceived legitimacy of status differences. Moreover, for the advantaged group, membership salience moderated the effects of quality (but not quantity) of contact. Indirect effects were instead not moderated by content of contact (an index considering the extent to which contact was characterized by a focus on differences vs. commonalities between groups).

Whereas the Palestinian Authority has been supportive of normalization policies, numerous domestic and international critics have argued that these policies serve to perpetuate occupation and its consequences. We examine how Palestinians understand normalization, to what degree they support various forms of ‘normalizing’ relations with Israelis, and how contact with Israelis relates to support for normalization and motivation for revolutionary resistance against the occupation. Based on a cross-sectional survey conducted among an adult sample (N = 159) in the West Bank in 2016, we show that the understanding of normalization was multi-faceted, and that support for contact and collaboration across group lines (i.e., with Israelis) depended on the type of intergroup relations. On average, respondents were more supportive of relations within the political sphere, e.g. civilian policies and diplomatic coordination, than of interpersonal contact, cultural cooperation or security coordination. Support for most types of intergroup relations was related to decreased motivation for revolutionary resistance. In line with research on ‘sedative’ effects of positive intergroup contact in historically unequal societies, we found that past positive contact with Israelis was linked to decrease in Palestinians’ motivation for revolutionary resistance through increased support for interpersonal contact and security coordination as forms of normalization. © 2019, PsychOpen.
