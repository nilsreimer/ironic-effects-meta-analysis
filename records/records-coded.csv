Previous studies have highlighted how interculturality facilitates the adaptation of migrants in the host country. This study explores (i) how face-to-face (FTF) and mediated contact and perceived discrimination predict stereotyping, and (ii) how contact, perceived discrimination and stereotyping predict interculturality. A web-based survey was conducted among university students from the People’s Republic of China (n = 585) in Singapore. FTF contact reduced stereotyping better than mediated contact. Perceived discrimination increased stereotyping of the host society by migrants, whereas stereotyping negatively affected interculturality.

Controlling for socio-demographic variables, members of some ethnic minority groups endorsed weak assimilation to a greater extent than the majority. Within members of the majority, the French-speaking Belgians held similar attitudes towards assimilation to the Dutch-speaking Belgians. Among ethnic minorities, the identification of pupils from some foreign-origin countries with the mainstream society was positively associated with the endorsement of strong assimilation, while their ethnic identification remained non-significant. Intergroup friendship among pupils of foreign origin was positively related to strong assimilation. Moreover, pupils of foreign origin who experienced institutional discrimination against ethnic minorities in favour of the majority endorsed strong assimilationism to a lesser extent. Among the majority, the perception that people of foreign origin are victims of discrimination was positively related to the endorsement of weak assimilation. However, this association was mediated by the experience by the majority of institutional discrimination against the majority and in favour of ethnic minorities. In-group identification among the majority was not associated with the endorsement of assimilation.

Fishbein and Ajzen's theory of attitudes was used to test the relationship between beliefs about attributes associated with AAPs and the evaluations of those attributes and AAP attitude. Both qualitative and quantitative research were conducted, including 675 field and student respondents in the quantitative study. Multiple regression was used to analyze the data. As hypothesized, a multiplicative relationship was found between the beliefs and evaluations of attributes associated with AAPs; however, the belief composite did not mediate the effects of race and sex on attitude. As hypothesized, there were significant differences in the belief composite for males and females, and across racial groups. There were no differences in the belief composite and attitude of the student and field respondents. Information frame was manipulated for positive, neutral, and negative conditions, with significant effects for frame on White respondents. Twenty-seven percent (184) of respondents mailed in postcards voting their position on AAPs to Congressional representatives. Over-sampling was conducted to allow for analysis of minority group members' AAP attitudes, including Asian-Americans. Attitudes of Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and Whites, respectively, were most-to-least favorable. Strong and consistent race differences were observed throughout the data. This study contributes to the literature on attitudes toward AAPs by testing the Fishbein and Ajzen theory of attitudes, identifying beliefs and evaluations of attributes associated with AAPs across different racial/ethnic groups. It was demonstrated that AAP attitudes may be changed through presentation of information, however, they are not easily manipulated, nor completely captured by high-level, abstract beliefs and evaluations of attributes associated with AAPs.","management , minority & ethnic groups , sociology",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Method: Our sample comprised 1,975 6th graders (Mage = 11.53, SDage = 0.69, 47% female) in Germany, of whom 1,213 (61%) were of immigrant background, defined as having at least 1 parent born in a different country. A total of 83 countries of origin were represented. We applied a multilevel framework to assess the impact of individual-level and class-level predictors on intergroup outcomes, controlling for the classroom ethnic composition, school track, and individual-level covariates. Immigrant background was treated as a moderator. Results: The 2 types of cultural diversity norms were generally associated with more positive intergroup outcomes. Some of the associations differed in strength between students of immigrant and nonimmigrant background. There were stronger associations of equality/inclusion with higher outgroup orientation among students of nonimmigrant background and with lower perceived discrimination among students of immigrant background. Ethnic composition, as well as the classroom-aggregated diversity norms (diversity climate) showed weaker relations with the outcome variables. Conclusions: Equality/inclusion norms and cultural pluralism norms can make complementary contributions to positive relations between students of immigrant and nonimmigrant background. Equality/inclusion norms foster positive contact and equal treatment, while cultural pluralism norms emphasize that it is also important to value diversity.1 (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",equality; cultural diversity; multiethnic classrooms; intergroup relations; cultural pluralism,Journal Article,NA,PsycInfo

Friendship patterns and predictors were quantitatively assessed for the 114 Natives, with qualitative examination of the development and qualities of the six friend pairs. Results of quantitative analysis revealed that 80% of this sample reported friendship investment with Whites, and 55% reported friendship investment with sametribe members. Over 90% of participants were open to engaging in friendships with member of any ethnicity or race. Approximately 98% of participants reported being targeted for racial discrimination, with most reporting some distress, often at a low level. Significant positive correlates of past and future friendships with Whites included: household income in childhood, identification with White culture, racial/ethnic composition of students in college, multicultural experiences, and past support from parents. Multiple regressions included as significant predictors of past friendships: past parental support (t = 6.488, p &lt; .001), past multicultural experiences (t = 3.852, p &lt; .001), racial composition in college (t = 3.083, p = .003), and diversity climate in high school (t = 2.468, p = .015). Multiple regressions for future friendships with Whites revealed as significant predictors: past friendships (t = 5.187, p &lt; .001), and past parental support (t = 2.507, p = .014). Qualitative findings revealed authenticity/acceptance, communication, similarity, and trust as aspects of close friendships with non-Natives. Opportunities to share cultural teachings, and shared cultural interests helped friendships develop. Participants’ descriptions of their friendships largely coincided with contact/opportunity theories, with propinquity allowing homophily, reciprocation, and disclosure to develop within the friendship. All friendship pairs weathered periods of time during which contact between friends became infrequent, but all participants asserted that they were still close friends during those periods.

Kim, Tae Yeun",2015,The influence of perceived racial discrimination on depressive symptoms and school outcomes among Asian American adolescents,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Asian American (AA) adolescents typically receive attention for their successful academic achievement, but rarely for their difficulties and problems. They show a paradoxical and unique developmental pattern of poor psychological well-being despite fewer problem behaviors and better school outcomes. To shed light on this unique pattern, the current study examines one of the factors that might be most important, although largely unexplored: racial discrimination. In addition, significant differences exist in youth outcomes across Asian subgroups. Specifically, this study examines how perceived racial discrimination influences depressive symptoms and school outcomes among three subgroups of AA adolescents, those of Cambodian, Korean, and Vietnamese dissent. It considers whether and how co-ethnic friendship, ethnic identity, and social support mediate the negative influence of perceived discrimination on depressive symptoms and school outcomes for Cambodian American (CA), Korean American (KA), and Vietnamese American (VA) adolescents. Two datasets were used: one from the Korean American Families (KAF) Project and the other from the Cross Cultural Families (CCF) Project. The KAF Project surveyed KA (n = 220) adolescents in middle school and their parents living in Midwest metropolitan areas in 2007 and 2008. The CCF Project is a five-year longitudinal study of a panel of CA (n = 164) and VA (n = 163) youth and their mothers, which started in 2001 with third through sixth graders in a Pacific Northwest public school district. The present study used Time 1 data for youth (KAF) collected in 2007 and Wave 4 data for youth (CCF) collected in 2004, in which youth participants’ age ranges were comparable between the three groups. Path analysis was conducted using MPlus to test the hypothesized relationships between perceived discrimination and adolescent outcomes (i.e., depressive symptoms, school misbehaviors, grades) and several mediators (i.e., co-ethnic friendship, ethnic identity, social support). The results are consistent with a story that suggests that perceived discrimination increased depressive symptoms for KA and VA adolescents, but it increased school misbehaviors only for CA adolescents. Among KA adolescents, perceived racial discrimination increased ethnic identity, which in turn increased social support, thereby reducing depressive symptoms. The results for KA adolescents show the significant mitigating role of the mediators on the negative impact of perceived discrimination on mental health. Conversely, among VA adolescents, perceived discrimination was not associated with ethnic identity, but ethnic identity was related to social support, which in turn was associated with lower depressive symptoms, fewer misbehaviors in school and better grades. Similarly, among CA adolescents, discrimination and ethnic identity were not significantly associated, but having more co-ethnic friendship was related to more social support, and related to lower depressive symptoms, fewer misbehaviors in school and better grades This study offers insights into the way in which perceived racial discrimination may exert a negative impact on children’s mental health and school outcomes and how the mechanisms that explain this relationship vary across AA subgroups. The results provide several implications for practice. For example, ethnic identity and social support should be targeted for intervention as they could improve the mental health and academic outcomes of youth across all AA subgroups. Perceived discrimination increases ethnic identity, but only among KA youth. This finding might indicate that the experience of adversity can be less detrimental if adversities such as racial discrimination can serve as an opportunity to strengthen a protective factor like ethnic identity. It is intriguing, however, that perceived racial discrimination did not strengthen ethnic identity among VA and CA adolescents. These findings of varying mechanisms across subgroups provide additional empirical support to tailor interventions for various AA subgroups.",social work,Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Results show that about half of Blacks and Hispanics have feared discrimination in the past year. Multivariate results indicate that fear is most likely if one has experienced victimization first-hand and when one's parent is affected by discrimination.

The current research aimed to test imagined contact effects on minority group members' acculturation strategies (contact participation and culture maintenance), perceived discrimination, feelings of belongingness, and social acceptance across three studies conducted in the United Kingdom (Study 1) and Turkey (Studies 2 and 3). Method: The sample consisted of Eastern Europeans in Study 1 (N = 63) and Kurds in Study 2 and 3 (N = 66 and 210, respectively). Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions (control vs. imagined contact) and completed measures of acculturation, perceived discrimination, general belongingness, and social acceptance. Results: Findings showed that while imagined contact significantly reduced perceived discrimination and culture maintenance, and increased contact participation and social acceptance among Eastern Europeans (Study 1), it reduced social acceptance and contact participation among Kurds recruited from a conflict-ridden homogeneous setting (Study 2). With a larger and more heterogeneous sample of Kurds (Study 3), these effects occurred only among those with higher ingroup identification. Moreover, in all studies social acceptance mediated the effects of imagined contact on contact participation and perceived discrimination. Discussion. Findings offer important insights about the use of the imagined contact strategy among minority group members and imply the need to take into account the context-dependent nature of contact strategies.

The ethnic minority group participants were found to be much more in favor of multiculturalism than the majority group. Furthermore, ingroup identification, perceived discrimination, outgroup friendships, and the two ideological notions appeared to be related independently to multiculturalism. However, high ethnic identification was related to lower endorsement of multiculturalism among the majority group and to higher endorsement of multiculturalism among the minority group. In addition, outgroup friendships only had a positive effect on multiculturalism for the majority group.

On the one hand, socialising with higher-status alters might enable individuals to access valuable resources. On the other hand, status-discrepant friendships could be detrimental to mental health by engendering feelings of unfairness. We sought to examine the impact of status-discrepant social relationships on depressive symptoms in the 2012 Korean General Social Survey (KGSS), a nationally representative sample. We show that socialising with higher-status people is positively associated with depressive symptoms. There is no significant difference between those socialising with equivalent-status or with lower-status alters. Perceived unfairness also increase depressive symptoms. Respondents socialising with higher-status alters tend to report greater depressive symptoms as their perceived unfairness increases. Gender-stratified analyses reveal that the detrimental impact of status-discrepant relationships are observed for men only, not for women. These findings suggest that socialising with higher-status people can be a net detriment for mental wellbeing by increasing stress/frustration or decreasing psychological resources such as self-esteem, and that these effects are more pronounced for individuals who perceive that society is unfair. This pattern appears stronger for men, which might be associated with gender roles internalised through gender socialisation processes. © 2017 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness",depressive symptoms; gender; perceived unfairness; relative deprivation; social comparison; social relationships; social status; south korea,Article,Final,Scopus

However, the acculturation expectations have received relatively less attention from researchers, and support for multiculturalism has rarely been examined from the perspective of immigrants. The present study used the framework of the Mutual Intercultural Relations in Plural Societies (MIRIPS) project to investigate the acculturation experiences and intercultural relations in Hong Kong by incorporating mutual views of both the dominant and non-dominant groups. It also tested the mediating role of the dominant group's tolerance towards different cultural groups and the non-dominant group's perceived discrimination. Two community samples were recruited, including Hong Kong residents (N = 181) and immigrants from Mainland China (N = 182). Among Mainland immigrants, the integration strategy predicted both psychological adaptation and sociocultural adaptation. Multicultural ideology predicted psychological adaptation and played a significant role in intercultural contact with Hong Kong people through the mediation of lower perceived discrimination. Among Hong Kong residents, the integration expectation predicted psychological adaptation. Multicultural ideology indirectly affected intercultural contact with Mainland immigrants through the mediation of greater tolerance. These results suggest that the integration strategy and expectation are more important to intrapersonal functioning, whereas multicultural ideology may be more crucial in facilitating social interactions between members of the society of settlement and immigrants in culturally plural milieus. Future research should test the proposed models of dominant and non-dominant groups in other cultures.

On the other hand and independently of contact, better educated immigrants had a less positive attitude toward the native population because of lower perceived acceptance and higher perceived group discrimination.

Expectations of racial discrimination were assessed using vignettes of cross-race social situations involving an African American child in a social interaction with European Americans. There were 3 major findings. First, expectations for discrimination declined slightly from 3rd to 5th grade. Second, although racial composition of children's classrooms, number of European American friends, gender, and family poverty status were largely unrelated to social expectations, having more African American friends was associated with expecting more discrimination in cross-racial interactions from 3rd to 5th grade. Third, increases in racial centrality were related to increases in discrimination expectations, and increases in public regard were associated with decreases in discrimination expectations.

Overall, Malay students reported significantly poorer sociocultural adjustment than Chinese students, as well as more negative outcomes on a range of predictors. Path analysis for the total sample showed that higher family income led to greater sociocultural adjustment, but partially because it led to more contact with host and conationals, better language proficiency, lower perceived cultural differences and less perceived discrimination. Moreover, participants with higher English proficiency were better adapted, but partially because they perceived less cultural differences as well as having more contact with host nationals. Additionally, individuals reporting better sociocultural adjustment also reported better health statuses.

Among a great number of ethnic groups living in Kabardino-Balkaria, Kabardians and Balkars are one of the largest (they are so-called titular ethnic groups). Russians are the second largest of the ethnic groups after Kabardians. We report here the results of an empirical study of the intercultural relations, mutual acculturation, and adaptation of Kabardians and Balkars (N = 285) and Russians (N = 249). Specifically, we examine the relevance of three hypotheses formulated to understand intercultural relations: the multiculturalism hypothesis, the integration hypothesis, and the contact hypothesis. We conducted path analysis in AMOS with two samples: a sample of Russians and a sample of the two main ethnic groups (Kabardians and Balkars), and we further compared the path models with each other. The results revealed significant effects of security, intercultural contacts, multicultural ideology, acculturation strategies, and acculturation expectations on attitudes, life satisfaction, and self-esteem in both samples. These findings partially confirm the three hypotheses in both groups. However, we also identified a regionally specific pattern. We found that, in the Russian sample, the integration strategy was negatively related to wellbeing, while contact with the dominant ethnic group was positively related to well-being. At the same time, in the sample of Kabardians and Balkars, acculturation expectations of integration and assimilation were positively related to well-being. In the article, we discuss these regional specifics.

This study represents a pioneering effort in investigating whether the post-9/11 backlash against Arabs and Muslims has penetrated community college campuses, focusing upon the inter-relationships among the level of perceived discrimination, the degree of diversity of Arab and Muslim students’ campus friendships, and their sense of belonging to the college. Two conflict theories are advanced to explain why perceived discrimination might promote ethnic and religious clustering among Arab and Muslim community college students. The study employs a mixed methods design consisting of a 92-item survey and three focus groups. The survey sample consists of 753 Arab Christian, Arab Muslim, and non-Arab Muslim students from 21 community colleges in Southern California and Southeast Michigan. The primary finding was that there was a modest but positive relationship between the level of perceived discrimination and the percentage of campus friends who are of the same ethnicity but different religion. Student focus groups furnished insight into some students' reluctance to report discrimination in surveys. The implications of the study are to develop sensitive measures of the campus climate that draw out more subtle forms of discrimination.

In Study 1, participants were assigned to either high- or low-power experimental groups and then brought together to discuss either commonalities between the groups or intergroup differences. Commonality-focused contact, relative to difference-focused contact, produced heightened expectations for fair (i.e., egalitarian) out-group behavior among members of disadvantaged groups. These expectations, however, proved unrealistic when compared against the actions of members of the advantaged groups. Participants in Study 2 were Israeli Arabs (a disadvantaged minority) who reported the amount of positive contact they experienced with Jews.

They show a paradoxical and unique developmental pattern of poor psychological well-being despite fewer problem behaviors and better school outcomes. To shed light on this unique pattern, the current study examines one of the factors that might be most important, although largely unexplored: racial discrimination. In addition, significant differences exist in youth outcomes across Asian subgroups. Specifically, this study examines how perceived racial discrimination influences depressive symptoms and school outcomes among three subgroups of AA adolescents, those of Cambodian, Korean, and Vietnamese dissent. It considers whether and how co-ethnic friendship, ethnic identity, and social support mediate the negative influence of perceived discrimination on depressive symptoms and school outcomes for Cambodian American (CA), Korean American (KA), and Vietnamese American (VA) adolescents. Two datasets were used: one from the Korean American Families (KAF) Project and the other from the Cross Cultural Families (CCF) Project. The KAF Project surveyed KA (n = 220) adolescents in middle school and their parents living in Midwest metropolitan areas in 2007 and 2008. The CCF Project is a five-year longitudinal study of a panel of CA (n = 164) and VA (n = 163) youth and their mothers, which started in 2001 with third through sixth graders in a Pacific Northwest public school district. The present study used Time 1 data for youth (KAF) collected in 2007 and Wave 4 data for youth (CCF) collected in 2004, in which youth participants' age ranges were comparable between the three groups. Path analysis was conducted using MPlus to test the hypothesized relationships between perceived discrimination and adolescent outcomes (i.e., depressive symptoms, school misbehaviors, grades) and several mediators (i.e., co-ethnic friendship, ethnic identity, social support). The results are consistent with a story that suggests that perceived discrimination increased depressive symptoms for KA and VA adolescents, but it increased school misbehaviors only for CA adolescents. Among KA adolescents, perceived racial discrimination increased ethnic identity, which in turn increased social support, thereby reducing depressive symptoms. The results for KA adolescents show the significant mitigating role of the mediators on the negative impact of perceived discrimination on mental health. Conversely, among VA adolescents, perceived discrimination was not associated with ethnic identity, but ethnic identity was related to social support, which in turn was associated with lower depressive symptoms, fewer misbehaviors in school and better grades. Similarly, among CA adolescents, discrimination and ethnic identity were not significantly associated, but having more co-ethnic friendship was related to more social support, and related to lower depressive symptoms, fewer misbehaviors in school and better grades. This study offers insights into the way in which perceived racial discrimination may exert a negative impact on children's mental health and school outcomes and how the mechanisms that explain this relationship vary across AA subgroups. The results provide several implications for practice. For example, ethnic identity and social support should be targeted for intervention as they could improve the mental health and academic outcomes of youth across all AA subgroups. Perceived discrimination increases ethnic identity, but only among KA youth. This finding might indicate that the experience of adversity can be less detrimental if adversities such as racial discrimination can serve as an opportunity to strengthen a protective factor like ethnic identity.

The potential conflict between reducing prejudice and supporting engagement in collective action,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"This dissertation investigates how efforts to reduce prejudice and interpersonal discrimination could also undermine collective action by disadvantaged group members. In an extensive line of research, Gaertner, Dovidio and their colleagues have shown that prejudice and interpersonal discrimination against outgroup members can be reduced when identifications are shifted from separate groups to a larger superordinate identities (see Gaertner &amp; Dovidio, 2000 for a review). Other investigators (e.g. Ellemers, Kortekaas, &amp; Ouwerkerk, 1999; Simon, Stürmer, &amp; Steffens, 2000) have found that when groups are not evenly situated in social strata, strong identification with one's disadvantaged group is essential for participation in collective action to change unjust social stratification. Thus, the creation of a superordinate identity could undermine disadvantaged group members' identification with their disadvantaged ingroup, consequently reducing their likelihood of engaging in collective action. The two present studies investigate if a potential conflict exists. Study 1 is a secondary analysis of data from a survey of university students of color who were asked about their racial/ethnic identification, their contact with Whites, and their support for engaging in various forms of collective action to benefit their racial/ethnic group. Study 2 is a laboratory experiment that attempts to replicate Gaertner and Dovidio's reduction of prejudice via the creation of superordinate identity, but also includes a manipulation of group disadvantage, and adds measures of interest in engaging in collective action. The findings from both studies suggest that encouraging a superordinate identity has negative effects for collective action. The findings have important implications for understanding how the current directions in reducing intergroup bias, while well intended and extremely important for addressing the negative attitudes and actions of advantaged group members, may also be counter productive for greater social justice concerns.",social psychology,Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Focusing on disadvantaged groups' (i.e., racial/ethnic minorities) orientations toward advantaged groups, the present research experimentally investigated the potential of dual, relative to common, identity to produce greater willingness to engage in contact, while maintaining social change motivation. Relative to common identity, dual identity produced not only greater willingness to engage in contact, which was mediated by perceptions of shared values, but also greater social change motivation, mediated by decreased optimism about future relations. Thus, for dual identity, enhancing approach motivation (willingness for contact) does not necessarily undermine social change motivation.

The present study examined the sociocultural adjustment of sojourning Malaysian students in Britain. Eighty-one Malay and 110 Chinese students enrolled in various courses answered a self-report questionnaire that examined various aspects of sociocultural adjustment. A series of one-way analyses of variance showed that Malay participants experienced poorer sociocultural adjustment in comparison with their Chinese counterparts. They were also less likely than Chinese students to have contact with co-nationals and host nationals, more likely to perceive their actual experience in Britain as worse than they had expected, and more likely to perceive greater cultural distance and greater discrimination. The results of regression analyses showed that, for Malay participants, perceived discrimination accounted for the greatest proportion of variance in sociocultural adjustment (73%), followed by English language proficiency (10%) and contact with host nationals (4%). For Chinese participants, English language proficiency was the strongest predictor of sociocultural adjustment (54%), followed by expectations of life in Britain (18%) and contact with host nationals (3%). By contrast, participants' sex, age, and length of residence failed to emerge as significant predictors for either ethnic group. Possible explanations for this pattern of findings are discussed, including the effects of Islamophobia on Malay-Muslims in Britain, possible socioeconomic differences between Malay and Chinese students, and personality differences between the two ethnic groups.

Many U.S. medical schools have abandoned affirmative action, limiting the recruitment and reducing the admission of underrepresented minority (URM) students even though research supports the premise that the public benefits from an increase in URM physicians and that URM physicians are likely to serve minority, poor, and Medicaid populations. Faculty and students commonly assume they benefit from peer cultural exchange, and the published evidence for the past two decades supports this notion. This research examined the students' perceptions of the educational merits of a diverse student body by surveying medical students at two schools. Method. In 2000, medical students from all four years at Harvard Medical School and the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine were enrolled in a telephone survey about the relevance of racial diversity (among students) in their medical education. Students responded to the interviewer's questions on a five-point Likert-type scale. Results. Of the 55% of students who could be located, 97% responded to the survey. Students reported having little intercultural contact during their formative years but significantly more interactions during higher education years, especially in medical school. Students reported contacts with diverse peers greatly enhanced their educational experience. They strongly supported strengthening or maintaining current affirmative action policies in admissions. The responses and demography of the Harvard and UCSF students did not differ significantly, nor did they differ for majority students and URM students - all groups overwhelmingly thought that racial and ethnic diversity among their peers enhanced their education.

We replicated previous research showing that contact predicts outgroup attitudes positively and more strongly among advantaged than among disadvantaged group members. Of importance, we also found evidence suggesting that the relationship between positive contact and collective action may depend on group status and on collective action type. Frequent positive contact reduced nonviolent collective action tendencies among disadvantaged group members but not among advantaged group members. However, more positive frequent contact was linked to lower violence support among both advantaged and disadvantaged group members.

Some consider Mexican Americans similar to European Americans of a century ago that arrived in the United States with modest backgrounds but were eventually able to participate fully in society. In contrast, others argue that Mexican Americans have been racialized throughout U.S. history, and this limits their participation in society. The evidence of persistent educational disadvantages across generations and frequent reports of discrimination and stereotyping supports the racialization argument. In this paper, we explore the ways in which race plays a role in the lives of Mexican Americans by examining how education, racial characteristics, social interactions, relate to racial outcomes. We use the Mexican American Study Project, a unique data set based on a 1965 survey of Mexican Americans in Los Angeles and San Antonio combined with surveys of the same respondents and their adult children in 2000, thereby creating a longitudinal and intergenerational data set. First, we found that darker Mexican Americans, therefore appearing more stereotypically Mexican, report more experiences of discrimination. Second, darker men report much more discrimination than lighter men and than women overall. Third, more educated Mexican Americans experience more stereotyping and discrimination than their less educated counterparts, which is partly due to their greater contact with whites. Lastly, having greater contact with whites leads to experiencing more stereotyping and discrimination. Our results are indicative of the ways in which Mexican Americans are racialized in the United States.

Their availability and strength have been shown to predict lower levels of depression, higher self esteem, and higher life satisfaction. They can also alleviate the stress that often leads to negative mental health outcomes. However, studies examining the stress process rarely consider the fact that social networks like friendship groups are not a static resource that effects all people the same way. Rather, demographic characteristics of both the individual and their friends could change the role of friendship networks within the stress process. In this thesis, I investigate the importance of one such demographic characteristic: race. Racial and ethnic diversity continues to grow in the United States, contributing to an increase interracial and interethnic friendships. It is important to understand what impact racial difference might have on the stress process. In addition to using Leonard Peralin’s stress process model to understand these potential effects, I draw upon Gordon Allport’s Contact theory to inform my analysis. Contact Theory attempts to explain why and how intergroup contact leads to changes in racial attitudes. Increases in positive racial attitudes may lower unique stressors often experienced my racial minorities such as racial prejudice and acculturation. This research project provides a starting point for deeper analyses examining how contact theory and the stress process function together. I ask if racially diverse friendship networks affect adolescent mental well being (as measured by mental health and self-esteem) and if the race of the respondent moderate the effects of racial diversity in friendship networks on mental well-being. To answer these questions, I perform secondary data analysis of survey responses from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. I use public-use, cross-sectional data of adolescents from Wave 1 (’94–’95). Linear regression models predicting adolescent mental health found that racial difference in friendship networks is negatively associated with mental health for white adolescents. For Asian respondents, linear regression models found that racial difference in friendship networks was positively associated with both mental health and self-esteem. Results on Hispanic, Black, and “Other” race adolescents were non-significant. These results suggest that racial difference in friendship networks have varying associations on mental well-being that depend on the race of the adolescent. White adolescents with more diverse friend groups may experience increased stress resulting from an increased awareness of the racial prejudice that affects their friend’s lives. Asian adolescents may benefit from more diverse friend groups because it allows them to find a “sense of belonging” in environments where there is less opportunity to have same-race friendship networks. They also might face less discrimination from different-race peers, allowing the social support benefits of a racially different friendship networks to outweigh any increases in perceived discrimination from peers. The results indicate that future studies should continue studying how demographic characteristics influence the stress process, including the role of social networks. Policies should aim to provide educational resources teaching adolescents how to handle experiences of prejudice and to create positive points of contact for different race peers. Future studies should assess the validity of these results by performing longitudinal analyses that can provide information on how racially different friendship networks buffer specific stressors and discover if the relationships found in this analysis change over time.","mental health , social psychology , sociology",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

The literature has however produced a fuzzy discourse, full of assumptions and claims that are rarely tested. We attempt to disentangle some of these assumptions by providing empirical evidence on the mediating and moderating influence of inter-ethnic conflict and contact, and examine whether they underlie the erosion of health among minorities and white British respondents residing in diverse local areas. Analyses were conducted using multilevel models that relied on geocoded data from a random stratified sample of adults 16–75 years collected in the 2009–2011 Citizenship Survey merged to small area aggregated statistics from the 2011 UK census. The final sample comprised of minorities (n = 13,236) and white British (n = 15,021) residing in England. We find that local area deprivation matters much more for the health of minorities and whites than diversity. Yet, residing in diverse areas can be problematic for whites if it is accompanied by high levels of social distance measured by negative attitudes towards immigrants. Greater contact among minorities and whites, residing in more diverse areas appears to have no significant effect on health. Overall, the findings supported our hypothesis that residing in areas of greater diversity has a differential impact on minorities when compared to whites. In particular, diversity appear to be more beneficial for minorities, especially newly arriving migrants. The effect of contact as measured by social capital is dwarfed in comparison to the effect of deprivation, underlying the importance for policy makers to tackle structural inequalities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",conflict hypothesis; contact hypothesis; discrimination; diversity; england; ethnicity; neighbourhood; self-rated health; social capital,Article,Final,Scopus

In post-agreement societies, however, characterized more so by symbolic rather than material conflict, the role that intergroup contact and threat play in social action may be particularly complex. This article examines intergroup contact, intergroup threat, support for political violence, and political participation among a student sample (n = 152) of Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland. Results show that contact is associated with lower symbolic and realistic threat for both groups and to lower levels of support for political violence but not to political participation. Symbolic threat mediated the association between contact and support for political violence and between contact and political participation for the Protestant majority group only. This suggests that contact may have a positive effect upon group relations but that this is dependent upon status and the social-political context.

Head, Rachel Nicole",2013,Coping with Perceived Discrimination,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"While some scholars contend that Caribbean Black Americans’ socioeconomic successes suggest the declining significance of racism, ethnographic studies have found that Black Caribbean Americans are often shocked, disheartened, and angered by the racism they encounter in the U.S. This dissertation is an attempt to begin to understand how Black Americans—both foreign and native born—perceive and cope with racial discrimination. In Chapter 2, I examine factors contributing to perceptions of major lifetime and day-to-day discrimination. Major depressive disorder is the outcome of interest in Chapter 3. I examine its link with racism-related anger and whether or not religiousness serves as a resource, protecting mental health. In Chapter 4, I examine self-rated health, its association with perceived group and interpersonal racism, and the utility of political involvement in combating the deleterious health effects of perceived racism. The data for this project come from the adult sample of the National Survey of American Life (NSAL) and the National Survey of American Life-Self-Administered Questionnaire (NSALSAQ), which are part of the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES) data collection. The NSAL is unique in that it provides the first ever national sample of Caribbean Black Americans, the majority of whom are from or trace their heritage to Barbados, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and Trinidad-Tobago. Findings in Chapter 2 suggest that racism is an enduring problem in the U.S. for both foreign and native-born Black Americans and that it cannot simply be dismissed as a worldview that serves to protect one’s sense of self-worth. Furthermore, it appears to be an obstacle for Caribbean Black Americans pursuing the American dream and may be associated with decreasing perceptions among Caribbean Black professionals that hard work and perseverance are all one needs to succeed in the U.S. I find in Chapter 3 that anger in response to increases in day-to-day discrimination is negatively associated with major depressive disorder for Caribbean Black Americans, while, for African Americans, anger is positively associated with major depressive disorder. In addition, while African Americans and second generation Caribbean Black Americans show no significant effects of religiousness items on depression, first generation Caribbeans benefit from religious organizational involvement. In contrast, their mental health is threatened by increasing emotional and tangible religious support. I discuss these findings as they relate to the historical legacy of racism in the Caribbean and the U.S., measurement issues surrounding depression, and the resources available to immigrants. In Chapter 4 I find limited support for the argument that discrimination will promote political involvement. Perceptions of discrimination against oneself are not significantly associated with increases in political participation. Surprisingly, individual-level discrimination and perceptions of group discrimination are not associated with Black advancement organization membership either. Perceiving no change in racial discrimination over the past 20 years, however, increases political participation (i.e., the probability that one will vote, participate in political campaigns, or contact political officials). Perceptions of group discrimination appear to be particularly alienating for second generation Caribbean Black Americans compared to African Americans. Second generation respondents’ political participation declines precipitously as perceived group discrimination increases. Finally, I find that Black advancement organization membership provides health benefits beyond political participation. This dissertation makes substantive and methodological contributions by examining diversity in the Black American population in predictors, resources, and health consequences of perceived discrimination and by modeling perceived discrimination to account for both increases in perceived discrimination and predictors of the likelihood that one will never report discrimination.","social research , clinical psychology , ethnic studies",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

It answers two research questions: Does interreligious contact reduce negative outgroup attitudes equally for minority Christians and majority Muslims? Are mediation by perceived group threat and moderation by perceived discrimination equally important for religious minorities and majorities? The analysis is based on unique survey data collected from among Christian and Muslim students in Ambon (the Moluccas) and Yogyakarta (central Java). Results show that a higher quantity of interreligious contact reduces negative outgroup attitudes among majority Muslims but not among minority Christians. However, the quality of contact reduces negative attitudes regardless of relative group size. Perceived group threat is an important mediator of the contact-attitude relationship and is equally so for Christians and Muslims. Findings suggest that perceived discrimination does not affect the relationship between interreligious contact and negative attitudes.

The current study advances this goal by analyzing experiences with interpersonal racial discrimination. Existing research demonstrates that reports of such antagonistic encounters are widespread. This persistent interracial hostility may hinder the country’s adaptation to a more multi-racial reality. In three separate papers I consider the extent, correlates and consequences of interpersonal racial discrimination. The first paper examines how neighborhood racial composition can affect reports of discrimination. Using the Project for Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods and data from the U.S. Census, I analyze the discrimination experiences of black, Hispanic and white young adults. Results indicate different patterns across groups, which I characterize using the contact, group threat and ethnic density hypotheses. African Americans perceive the least discrimination in neighborhoods with few co-racial residents, following the contact hypothesis. Hispanics perceive the most discrimination in neighborhoods that are around half Hispanic and half non-Hispanic, following group threat theory. Finally, whites report decreasing discrimination levels as the neighborhood percentage white increases, following the ethnic density hypothesis. The causes and implications of these disparate patterns are discussed. The second paper examines whether experience with racial discrimination can perpetuate interracial hostility. I analyze how reported discrimination experiences are associated with negative racial attitudes among a sample of black, white and Hispanic adults from the Chicago Area Study. Further, I place such hostile experiences within one’s totality of interracial experiences by simultaneously considering positive contact experiences (interracial friendship) and interracial proximity (neighborhood and workplace contact). Through this approach, I present a more holistic understanding of real-world interracial contact. Multivariate results indicate three distinct patterns. The first occurs commonly among Hispanics and suggests that friendship contact mitigates the negative attitudinal consequences of discrimination. The second occurs occasionally among African Americans and suggests that friendship is beneficial only for those not experiencing discrimination. The final pattern, occurring among whites, suggests that the consequences of discrimination grow more extreme with greater interracial neighborhood contact. The final paper examines the understudied phenomenon of racial discrimination fear. I consider the extent and correlates of these fears among a sample of black and Hispanic adolescents from the final wave of the Project for Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. I lay the groundwork for a new line of inquiry focused on discrimination fears and develop hypotheses linking fear to direct discrimination experience, indirect experience and environmental signals. Results show discrimination fear to be common among minority adolescents and more prevalent than among their parents. Multivariate results indicate that fears are most likely when one has experienced discrimination directly. Indirect experience also predicts greater fear, suggesting that the consequences of discriminatory acts are not limited to the immediate victim. Finally, among African Americans, the presence of racial out-groups in one’s neighborhood acts as a signal for discrimination, resulting in greater fear.","african american studies , black studies , social psychology , ethnic studies , hispanic american studies",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

More than three hundred years of de jure racial discrimination had ended. But many argue that the effects of these past policies continue to plague our society today, despite the fact that black people and white people tend to support the concept of racial equality. One of the mechanisms employed to ensure racial equality is affirmative action. Affirmative action policies are designed to redress the damage done by laws and policies that no longer exist. Many scholars, however, find white opposition to race-targeted policies is strong. Thus there is a paradox, white people support racial equality, and yet there is white resistance to racial policies designed to foster that equality. Where can policy makers take us next? Which Americans—black and white—support policy initiatives to address the effect of our historical mistakes? The scientific literature is currently unable to clarify this puzzle. There are four theories which help conceptualize racial attitudes. In this study, each theory is tested using multiple regression models. Unlike most previous studies, the attitudes of both blacks and whites are examined. These attitudes were collected from an in-home survey conducted in the last half of 1992. A total of 1,124 metropolitan Detroit area residents were interviewed in ninety-six separate neighborhoods. The most significant findings include: ideological opposition to affirmative action policies by both blacks and whites can be enough to make them oppose affirmative action policies; black people demonstrate some of the same antiblack stereotypes and attitudes as whites, thus clouding previous conceptions of white racism; motivations of self-interest only influence affirmative action policy positions among blacks, and only when individuals believe racial discrimination has affected their workplace success; and finally, close interracial contact is related to both blacks and whites increased opposition to affirmative action policies.","political science , minority & ethnic groups , sociology , african americans , american studies",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Positive intergroup contact with the dominant group (New Zealand Europeans) predicted increased opposition to a topical reparative policy (Maori ownership of the foreshore), and this was fully mediated by increased support for the ideology of meritocracy. Intergroup contact may enable the ideological legitimation of inequality among members of disadvantaged groups, engendering political attitudes that are detrimental to their group's interests.

Studies 1 and 2 tested the simultaneous effects of intergroup contact and established predictors of collective action on collective action tendencies and ingroup and outgroup oriented policies among Blacks and Whites in South Africa, and compared the effects of intergroup contact and social identity on collective action tendencies via relative deprivation and group efficacy. The findings revealed that while social identity was positively associated with collective action tendencies, both directly and indirectly, effects of contact were negative and indirect via relative deprivation and group efficacy. Studies 3 and 4 investigated the effects of contact and social identity on collective action tendencies via perceived threats. Using data from Turkish and Kurdish groups in Turkey, I found that social identity predicted collective action tendencies positively, both directly and indirectly, while it predicted outgroup attitudes negatively and indirectly via perceived threats. Intergroup contact, on the other hand, predicted outgroup attitudes positively, both directly and indirectly, and collective action tendencies negatively via perceived threats. In Study 5, intergroup contact was positively associated, both directly and indirectly, via perspective taking and collective guilt, associated with outgroup oriented collective action tendencies. In Study 6, the effect of social identity on ingroup oriented collective action was positive and direct. Intergroup contact with the weaker minority group, on the other hand, was positively associated with outgroup oriented collective action tendencies via perspective taking. Additionally, intergroup contact with the majority outgroup moderated this relationship. When participants reported more contact with the majority group, intergroup contact with the weaker minority was not associated with outgroup oriented collective action tendencies. However, when the participants reported less contact with the majority group, intergroup contact positively predicted outgroup oriented collective action tendencies.

We examined whether this is also the case among refugees. Furthermore, we extended research on return intentions by considering two social psychological experiences—host country identification and perceived discrimination—as mediators in the associations between the three aspects of integration and return wishes. Using a large survey among refugees from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and Somalia in the Netherlands, we found that employment was not related to return wishes. Higher-educated refugees and those proficient in Dutch perceived more discrimination and were therefore more likely to want to return. Simultaneously, language proficiency was also related to a wish to stay via increased host country identification. Contacts with natives were related to less discrimination and more identification, and therefore to a wish to stay.

Instruments utilized included Ong and Ward's (2005) Index of Sojourner Social Support (ISSS) Scale and Black and Stephens' (1989) scale for general adjustment.

Shammas, Diane",2009,The effects of campus friendships and perceptions of racial climates on the sense of belonging among Arab and Muslim community college students,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Apart from the wide-scale media attention that Arabs and Muslims have received in the United States and abroad since 9/11, these two target populations have been largely unexamined at both the two-year and four-year college levels. This dissertation study represents a pioneering effort in investigating whether the post-9/11 backlash against Arabs and Muslims has penetrated community college campuses. The main objective of the study is to investigate the potential inter-relationships among the level of perceived discrimination, the degree of diversity of Arab and Muslim students' campus friendships, and their sense of belonging to the college. This study challenges the tenets of Allport's contact hypothesis and advances instead two conflict theories, integrated threat theory and social dominance theory that provide the theoretical framework for why perceived discrimination might promote ethnic and religious clustering among Arab and Muslim community college students. The study employs a mixed methods design, a 92-item survey, and three focus groups. The survey sample consists of 753 Arab Christian, Arab Muslim, and non-Arab Muslim students from 15 community colleges in Southern California and six community colleges in Southeast Michigan. The results of the study are as follows: (a) there is a positive relationship between Arab and Muslim students' campus friendships and the sense of belonging to the college; (b) there were no significant correlations between the level of perceived discrimination and the percentage of campus friends who were of the same ancestry and same religion, same ancestry and different religion, same religion and different ancestry, and different religion and different ancestry; (c) there was no relationship between strength of ethnic identity and the percentage of campus friends from the four ethnic/faith friendship groups; and, (d) there were no interactions between the strength of ethnic identity and the level of perceived discrimination on the dependent variables, sense of belonging and the percentage of campus friends from the four ethnic/faith friendship groups. Student focus groups furnished testimony on their experiences with discrimination on campus as well as provided insight into Arab and Muslim students' reluctance to report discrimination in surveys. The implications of the study are for community college researchers to tailor their measures of campus climate to fit specifically the institutional type and the student demographic profile. Campus climate measures must include items that not only draw out more subtle forms of discrimination, but also inquire into a wide scope and frequency of discriminatory behaviors.

International migration has risen exponentially in recent decades due to advances in technology and com munications. According to the International Organization for Migration (OIM, 2010), the estimated number of international migrants in the world for that year was 214 million, doubling the previous two decades. Globalization has promoted exchanges among different cultures, but also caused the collision between different value systems, beliefs and customs that, in many cases, generates situations of confusion or discomfort in people (Furnham & Bochner, 1986). Approxi mate ly 2.9 million people each year decide to make or complete their studies in other countries (OECD, 2008). Argentina receives an increasing number of students from other Latin-American countries, attracted by the language, the academic prestige of the local universities and the favorable economic conditions (Filmus, 2007). At the pre sent, international students represent 1.6% of university students in Argentina. Therefore, Argen tina is the fourth host country of America, after United States, Canada and Uruguay. As a result of intercultural contact, students go through the psychological process called acculturation, which involves affective, behavioral and cogni tive changes. Taking into account the antecedents mention ed, this research proposed to identify predictors of socio-cultural adaptation based on socio-demographic, cultural and psychological variables, in international students who decided to make their university studies in Argentina. The participants of the study were 216 migrant stu dents who were studying different careers. 57% were women (n = 124) and 43% males (n = 92) with an average age of 24.18 years (SD = 4.55). 86% (n = 186) were born in Latin-Ame rica. The remaining 14% came from Europe and Asia. The average residence time in Argentina was 3.31 years. The reasons for their arrival in Argentina were diverse, 50% (n = 108) of them considered that Argentina was a good place to study for its academic prestige and low costs. The remaining half was divided between family reasons (n = 47, 21%), to have a different cultural experi ence (n = 30, 14%), for student exchange (n = 19, 9%) or others reasons (n = 13, 6%). Regarding socio-economic status, the majority of respondents said they were in the middle class (n = 107, 50%) and upper middle (n = 82, 38%). Different instruments, designed ad hoc or adapted, were used to measure the variables involved in the study. To measure cultural variables were used instruments to assess perceived cultural distance, frequency of contact with foreigners and local habitants, intergroup anxiety and perceived discrimination. To measure psychological varia bles, were used instruments to assess social support and life satisfaction. Besides, were used instruments to assess the level of sociocultural adaptation. Based on results obtained, it could not be verified influence by socio-demograph ic varia bles (age and residence time). In contrast, among the cultural variables it was found that low levels of perceived discrimination an inter-grupal anxiety predicts good levels of sociocultural adaptation. Regarding psychol ogical varia bles, it was confirm ed that social support and perceived satisfaction contribute to this adaptation. In summary, cultural and psy chological variables predict most success ful socio-cultural adaptation than socio-demograph ic variables. One of the limitations of the study was the low inclusion in the sample of immigrants from countries with greater cultural distance. Futures studies can focuses on the anal ysis of the processes of adaptation with foreign students with language and customs more distant than Latin-American students. Other future re search can study the percep tions of those who receive foreign students (host country) and analyze their relation ship and influence on the perception of discrimination and prejudice from immigrants.",discrimination; intergrupal anxiety; international students; predictors; social suppor; socio-cultural adaptation,Article,Final,Scopus

A gender analysis,Brain Sciences,8,8,NA,NA,10.3390/brainsci8080140,"Recent research has documented poor mental health among high socioeconomic status (SES) Blacks, particularly African American males. The literature has also shown a positive link between SES and perceived discrimination, suggesting that perceived discrimination may explain why high SES Black males report poor mental health. To better understand the role of contextual factors in explaining this pattern, we aimed to test whether school racial composition explains why high income Black youth perceive more discrimination. We explored these associations by ethnicity and gender. Using data from the National Survey of American Life-Adolescent supplement (NSAL-A), the current study included 810 African American and 360 Caribbean Black youth, with a mean age of 15. Ethnicity, age, gender, income-to-needs ratio (SES), skin color, school racial composition, and perceived (daily) discrimination were measured. Using Stata 15.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA), we fitted seven structural equation models (SEMs) for data analysis in the pooled sample based on the intersection of ethnicity and gender. Considerable gender by ethnicity variations were found in the associations between SES, school racial composition, and perceived discrimination. For African American males but not African American females or Caribbean Black males or females, school racial composition fully mediated the effect of SES on perceived discrimination. The role of inter-racial contact as a mechanism for high discrimination and poor mental health of Black American adolescents may depend on their intersection of ethnicity and gender. School racial composition may be a mechanism for increased perceived discrimination among high SES African American males. © 2018 by the authors.

The present study adopts an ecological approach to investigate how refugees perceive the welcoming climate in Germany and the consequences of this perception. To further explore the refugees' situation, we examined several predictors of their psychological adjustment and acculturation attitudes. In a field study in Eastern Germany with N = 94 refugees as participants, we assessed the perceived context of reception, and perceived acculturation attitudes as contextual variables, discrimination and contact as intergroup variables and, on the individual level, psychological adjustment as well as the personal acculturation attitudes as dependent variables. The results revealed that more perceived discrimination resulted in an increase in reported psychological problems. Refugees living in asylum centers reported more psychological problems and more perceived discrimination than those living in independent housing. The perceived context of reception positively predicted refugees' desire for maintenance of intergroup relations with the host society. Positive intergroup contact lowered their desire for cultural maintenance. In sum, this study gives us rare and valuable insight into refugees' perspectives in the context of recent immigration to Germany. In doing so, it emphasizes the importance of a welcoming climate. The study shows how meaningful the assessment of the perceived context of reception is. Practical implications for fields such as the accommodation of refugees are discussed.

This article considers this possibility by examining the link between interpersonal discrimination and racial attitudes. Further, I situate discrimination into one’s totality of interracial exposure by analyzing whether other forms of interracial contact (friends, neighbors, or coworkers) condition the discrimination–attitudes association. Using representative data from the Chicago Area Study, I find that black, Hispanic, and white adults express greater feelings of racial threat and ingroup closeness when they report discrimination. The conditional effects vary across race/ethnicity. Among Hispanics, friendship mitigates these attitudinal consequences. For blacks, friendship is beneficial only for those not experiencing discrimination. Among whites, discrimination’s attitudinal consequences grow more extreme with greater neighborhood contact. Overall, the results suggest that (1) racial attitudes should be added to the list of interpersonal racial discrimination consequences and (2) discrimination is often a primary form of contact contributing to the development of racial attitudes. © 2017 North Central Sociological Association.",NA,Article,Final,Scopus

The questions for investigation were: Given various backgrounds and experiences in school, how do Eastern, Western and Mixed descent high school children express: (1) Their attitudes toward self and other groups. (2) Their beliefs concerning interethnic relations (e.g., intermarriage, friendship, and leadership). (3) Personal self-esteem. The method involved a survey of 861 Jewish high school pupils from Eastern, Western, and Mixed parentage. The students were from 31 classes in 12 integrated and nonintegrated high schools from 12 cities in Israel. Gathering data from students was done by means of questionnaires, constructed to this end and distributed and filled out in the classroom during class time. The independent variables included ethnic descent and low, moderate and high levels of school ethnic integration from high Eastern to high Western. The dependent variables were based on an original, validated student interethnic attitude and self-esteem questionnaire which produced six significant factors: (1) Acceptance of segregation. (2) Openness to integration. (3) Solidarity with one's own group. (4) Negative Eastern stereotyping. (5) General stereotyping. (6) Perception of ethnic deprivation. The results showed that school integration had a significant, positive impact on attitudes (integrated schools created more openness and tolerance). Further, children of mixed parents were most tolerant and had least negative stereotyping. Eastern Jewish children were more accepting than Western. The results of the self-esteem questionnaire were inconclusive and, contrary to expectation, no differences were found for self-esteem attitudes between Eastern and Western students whether in the majority or minority. The results of this study shed light on the issues of integration. They emphasize the importance of interethnic contact in the schools for improving students' attitudes towards each other and for achieving positive results in the efforts toward integration. Thus, the findings may contribute to constructive policies of interethnic relations in the educational system. Israeli schools, therefore, have a timely opportunity to break down divisive attitudes and stereotypes (while maintaining self-esteem) and to contribute to the unity of Israeli life.","educational sociology , bilingual education , multicultural education",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

This study investigates whether Russian Jewish immigrants in Israel and ethnic German immigrants in Germany differ in their FH rates, which variables predict friendship homophily in each sample, and whether relative strength of association between predictors and FH differs between both samples. FH is measured using reports on best friends, cliques, and distant friendships. Results found FH, in general, to be more pronounced in the Russian Jewish sample, and acculturation orientation and language use predicted interindividual differences in FH in both samples. Perceived discrimination predicted higher levels of FH in cliques and distant friendships only in Israel. Findings suggest the importance of acculturation in selecting intra- or interethnic friends.

This thesis extends current knowledge on cross-ethnic friendships by examining the prevalence and effects of such friendships on various developmental outcomes among ethnic majority and minority status children attending multiethnic schools. While Chapter 1 presented an overview of the literature on cross-ethnic friendships, following empirical chapters (Chapters 2-6) demonstrated findings from a comprehensive 3-wave school study conducted in London schools. Chapter 2 focused on patterns of cross-ethnic friendships and showed specific relationships between ethnic diversity, ethnic group and cross-ethnic friendships. Chapter 3 indicated that cross-ethnic friendships are related to positive outcomes such as psychological well-being, resilience and academic outcomes and moderate the negative effects of discrimination. Chapter 4 showed that interpersonal processes of self-disclosure and ideal self affirmation mediated the associations between cross-ethnic friendships and well-being measures. Chapter 5 examined anxiety and intimate self-disclosure in both same- and cross-ethnic friendships and indicated that reduced anxiety is a unique process whereby cross-ethnic friendships relate to positive outcomes. Chapter 6 revealed longitudinal associations between cross-ethnic friendships and positive outcomes and showed that these associations are stronger in classrooms with lower classroom racial tension. Finally, Chapter 7 investigated cross-ethnic friendships in the light of motivational outcomes; results of two experimental studies indicated that mental representations of cross-ethnic friendships may have effects on future career and academic choices of ethnic minority young adolescents. Overall, findings show that cross-ethnic friendships are important resources for children, providing benefits for the development of psychological, academic and motivational outcomes among children. The role of cross-ethnic friendships on positive development is discussed in the light of ethnic group differences and implications for school policies in multiethnic settings (Chapter 8).",no umi subject assigned,Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Abstract (Frenchch)
Le contact inter-groupes positif peut nuire a l'engagement des membres d'un groupe defavorise envers l'action collective. Toutefois, nous formulons l'hypothese que le contact inter-groupes positif ou un membre du groupe favorise communique expressement son opposition a l'egard de l'inegalite entre les groupes (<< contact de soutien ) ne nuirait pas a l'action collective, voire agirait comme un stimulant parmi les membres du groupe defavorise. L'Etude 1 portait sur le contact inter-groupes entre des etudiants internationaux et des etudiants du pays dans une universite d'Australie. L'Etude 2 portait sur des immigrants au Canada ayant un contact inter-groupes avec une personne nee au Canada. Les resultats ont revele que le contact de soutien a fait augmenter l'engagement a l'egard de l'action collective, comparativement a diverses autres conditions comportant d'autres formes de contact inter-groupes positif. Il est apparu que l'accroissement du nombre d'injustices percues agit en tant que mediateur cle dans la relation entre le contact de soutien et l'engagement accru envers l'action collective.

Accordingly, the last decade has seen much research that has examined ways in which racial and ethnic diversity on college campuses can be defined, theorized, measured, and assessed, all with the intent of advancing our understanding of the educational benefits of diversity. Nonetheless, many questions remain unexplored, and the increasing level of scrutiny on the educational benefits of diversity suggests the need for even more compelling and refined empirical evidence. The present study sought to respond to this empirical need by examining a critical area that remains under-researched in the diversity debate, namely, researching the effects of students' pre-college experiences and pre-college racial environments on college diversity outcomes. Understanding students' pre-college experiences with diversity can serve to illuminate relationships that may have been under-estimated in prior diversity research. If the main effects of pre-college measures on students' diversity outcomes have been systematically under-examined, this suggests that the true educational benefits for students are in fact stronger and more compelling than have been established. This study's main conclusion is two-fold: students' pre-college racial environments and experiences do have notable perpetuation effects on college diversity outcomes such as cross-racial interactions and students' attitudes about racial discrimination; nonetheless, the multivariate results unmistakably show that racially and ethnically diverse college settings as well as students' college diversity experiences serve to significantly mediate or interrupt these perpetuation effects. In spite of students' segregated pre-college environments and experiences, public universities that are more structurally diverse and that foster more diverse curricular and co-curricular activities can positively affect students' levels of interactions with diverse peers as well as complicate their attitudes about racial discrimination in our society. These findings have implications both for K-12 desegregation efforts as well as for the policy debate on affirmative action in higher education.","higher education , minority & ethnic groups , sociology",Dissertation/Thesis,NA,ProQuest

Instead, the effect of contact quality at T1 on national identification and out-group attitudes at T2 was indirect via perceived discrimination and out-group rejection at T2.

Segregation by race and social contact did not predict change in confidence and frequency to take social justice action. Prior knowledge about racial inequality and motivation to bridge difference did predict change in action. IGD is a promising cultural competence pedagogy.

Its impact on collective action and individual mobility intentions among members of a disadvantaged group,Journal of Social Issues,71,3,536,553,10.1111/josi.12127,"A current debate surrounds the issue of whether prejudice-reducing interventions such as intergroup contact may reduce resistance to unequal intergroup relations among disadvantaged groups. Addressing this question, this research investigates how positive contact with members of the advantaged group shapes action strategies to cope with disadvantage. Using survey data from a sample of Latino Americans (N = 112), structural equation modeling revealed that friendship contact with Anglo-Whites was overall negatively associated with interest in collective action. This relation was due to both reduced identification with the disadvantaged group and positive attitudes toward the advantaged group, which predicted reduced anger about inequality. Contact was also positively associated with an individual mobility orientation, a relation which was explained through increased perceived permeability. Individual mobility orientation did not, however, predict reduced motivation for collective action. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings for societal change and novel directions for future research are discussed.

Despite increasing numbers of refugees and immigrants entering Norway in recent years, little is known about the relationship between immigrants’ different social identities and their feeling of integration into Norwegian society. The main goal of the present research is to fill this gap by investigating whether relationships found in other European countries replicate in the Norwegian context. In line with theoretical considerations and earlier international findings, results from two studies with different immigrant groups (Study 1: high school students; N = 97; Study 2: university students; N = 93) show that the more young immigrants in Norway endorse their national (i.e., Norwegian) identity, the less they endorse their ethnic identity (e.g., Kurdish). We further show that perceived conflict between the two cultures cannot explain the negative relationship between national and ethnic identity. In addition, immigrants’ national identity endorsement is positively related to their dual identity endorsement (e.g., Kurdish-Norwegian). Positive contact with members of the receiving society predicts young immigrants’ feeling of being integrated in Norwegian society and this relationship is mediated by national identity. Results are discussed in terms of the crucial role social identities play in immigrants’ feeling of integration into European societies. © 2019 The Authors.

The article contains a review of social, psychological, and gender aspects of migration from three countries of Central Asia (former Soviet republic)-Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan-in Russia (St. Petersburg). The main objective of our study was to identify socio-psychological mechanisms of migration from Central Asia-the general and specific peculiarities of the acculturation process of migrant workers. Participants in the study were labor migrants from Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. The research was conducted in St. Petersburg. In total, 98 people aged from 19 to 42 years old took part in the research (median age = 32.26, SD = 3.44), among them, women made up 44% and men made up 56%. Three ethnic groups were represented in the sample: Kyrgyz people (34 persons), Tajik people (32 persons), and Uzbek people (32 persons). The research found both general and specific features related to certain ethnic groups. The research results showed that there were significant differences between the migrants from Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan by the following acculturation indicators: number of social contacts (friends) among representatives of their own ethnicity and among the Russian-speaking population, type of acculturation strategy, degree of life satisfaction, cultural and economic safety, and anxiety level. © 2020 by the authors.

Specifically, we propose that perceived group discrimination may serve as an essential boundary condition of the friendship‒prejudice relationship. Accordingly, analyses show that: (a) cross-group friendship predicts less prejudice, (b) perceived group discrimination relates to greater prejudice only among noncontacted ethnic minority members, and (c) greater perceived group discrimination enhances the ability of cross-group friendship to predict reduced prejudice toward majority members. The enhancing effect is inconsistent with previous research. Moreover, we show that perceived personal discrimination does not moderate the friendship‒prejudice relationship. Finally, analyses confirm the unique qualities of cross-group friendship, as perceived group discrimination does not predict greater prejudice when this type of contact is most intense. Analyses are performed on an unusually rich, national probability sample of ethnic minority members fielded in 2017 including 1211 respondents from Denmark.

Recent work, however, suggests that intergroup contact can undermine support for social change towards greater equality, especially among disadvantaged group members. Using a large and heterogeneous dataset (12,997 individuals from 69 countries), we demonstrate that intergroup contact and support for social change towards greater equality are positively associated among members of advantaged groups (ethnic majorities and cis-heterosexuals) but negatively associated among disadvantaged groups (ethnic minorities and sexual and gender minorities). Specification-curve analysis revealed important variation in the size—and at times, direction—of correlations, depending on how contact and support for social change were measured. This allowed us to identify one type of support for change—willingness to work in solidarity— that is positively associated with intergroup contact among both advantaged and disadvantaged group members. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",NA,Article,Final,Scopus

While much is known about the determinants of inflammation, there is currently little information regarding the causes of variation in the functioning of TP53, even though it has been recognized for 40 years as the most potent of the cancer suppressor genes. The current paper explores the interrelationship between these two biomarkers and investigates the extent to which they are influenced by the social environment. Methods: Using structural equation modeling (SEM) and longitudinal observational data from a sample of several hundred African Americans, we tested the hypothesis that adversity – operationalized as racial discrimination- and coping resources – operationalized as religiosity and black friends - influence expression of TP53, for better or worse, through their impact on inflammation. Results: Correlational analysis showed inflammation and TP53 to be inversely related. Further, discrimination was positively related to inflammation and negatively related to TP53 expression, whereas religiosity and black friends were both negatively related to inflammation and positively related to TP53 expression. Finally, SEM indicated that the effect of the social environmental variables on TP53 expression was indirect through level of inflammation. Conclusions: In addition to its established contribution to cancer through DNA damage and cell proliferation, inflammation likely increases cancer risk indirectly by inhibiting expression of the TP53 cancer suppressor gene. Hence environmental and stress management interventions may do more than reduce inflammation's cell damaging effects; they may also lessen the chances of cancer by increasing expression of TP53. © 2019",NA,Article,Final,Scopus

Evidence from four European countries,Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,46,1,260,276,10.1080/1369183X.2019.1578203,"An important public debate in contemporary Europe is whether immigrant-origin Muslims will successfully integrate into mainstream society. We engage those debates by analysing national identification among immigrant-origin Muslim adolescents in England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden. A common argument is that the Islamic religion prevents Muslims from integrating because its practices are incompatible with mainstream European culture. However, we find that religiosity is not the most important predictor of Muslim identification. Instead, citizenship, contact with the native majority, and perceived discrimination are all as important as religiosity for predicting Muslim national identification. In addition, we find the same relationships between these variables and national identification among Muslim and non-Muslim immigrant-origin adolescents. Country of birth, host language proficiency, and socio-economic status, by contrast, are less important predictors of national identification of both groups. In sum, our findings suggest that Muslims are not necessarily a uniquely problematic population, as their national identification is best understood through dynamics that affect immigrants more broadly rather than Muslims specifically, though more research is necessary to identify specific causal pathways. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",integration; muslims; national identification,Article,Final,Scopus

Similarly, social identity theory has identified the conditions that lead individuals to challenge unequal social systems. Integrating these two major theories, the current study examined the processes underlying the relationship between intergroup contact and participants’ willingness to engage in collective action to challenge social inequality. Specifically, we tested sociostructural variables (status legitimacy and stability, and permeability of group boundaries) as potential mediators of contact in a sample of both advantaged (Italian high school students, N = 392) and disadvantaged (immigrant high school students, N = 165) group members. We found that contact was positively associated with motivation for change, an effect mediated by decreased perceived legitimacy of status differences. Moreover, for the advantaged group, membership salience moderated the effects of quality (but not quantity) of contact. Indirect effects were instead not moderated by content of contact (an index considering the extent to which contact was characterized by a focus on differences vs. commonalities between groups).

Whereas the Palestinian Authority has been supportive of normalization policies, numerous domestic and international critics have argued that these policies serve to perpetuate occupation and its consequences. We examine how Palestinians understand normalization, to what degree they support various forms of ‘normalizing’ relations with Israelis, and how contact with Israelis relates to support for normalization and motivation for revolutionary resistance against the occupation. Based on a cross-sectional survey conducted among an adult sample (N = 159) in the West Bank in 2016, we show that the understanding of normalization was multi-faceted, and that support for contact and collaboration across group lines (i.e., with Israelis) depended on the type of intergroup relations. On average, respondents were more supportive of relations within the political sphere, e.g. civilian policies and diplomatic coordination, than of interpersonal contact, cultural cooperation or security coordination. Support for most types of intergroup relations was related to decreased motivation for revolutionary resistance. In line with research on ‘sedative’ effects of positive intergroup contact in historically unequal societies, we found that past positive contact with Israelis was linked to decrease in Palestinians’ motivation for revolutionary resistance through increased support for interpersonal contact and security coordination as forms of normalization. © 2019, PsychOpen.
