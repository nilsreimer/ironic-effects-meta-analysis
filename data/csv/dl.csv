Extensive pilot testing was conducted on the interview scenarios in order to ensure that participants were familiar with the situations, and that the language was developmentally appropriate. The scenarios were presented in a preestablished order (see Crystal et al. 2008), with the last two contexts representing more intimate situations than those employed in earlier research (e.g., Killen et al. 2002; Killen and Stangor 2001). The scenarios were: excluding a crossrace peer from lunch at school (where a majority child does notwanttoinviteaminoritychildtohavelunchwithhim/her and another majority friend), excluding a cross-race peer froma sleepoverparty (where amajoritychild doesnotwant to invite a minority child to a sleepover), and excluding a cross-race peer from a high school dance (where a majority student does not want to invite a minority student from anotherschooltoaschooldanceasadate).Inordertocapture the historical dimension of racial exclusion in the United States, all three scenarios involved a European American child excluding an African American child. Brown (2008) reported that in a racially and ethnically diverse sample, US children often gave examples of discrimination directed towards African American children, when presented with open-ended questions about discrimination. In addition, she noted that these same children also gave examples of racial discrimination from a historical perspective, providing further support for our use of situations involving a EuropeanAmerican child excluding an African American child. After the presentation of each of the three scenarios participants responded to a series of assessments (1) Wrongfulness of race-based exclusion (How good or bad is it to exclude someone on the basis of their race?); (2) Stereotype assessment (What is it about race that makes people uncomfortable?); (3) Estimations of the frequency of race-based exclusion among peers (How often do you think children your age might not invite someone to lunch because they are a different race?); and (4) Bystander Response (What do you think a bystander child should do about race-based exclusion?).

Brown (2008) reported that in a racially and ethnically diverse sample, US children often gave examples of discrimination directed towards African American children, when presented with open-ended questions about discrimination. In addition, she noted that these same children also gave examples of racial discrimination from a historical perspective, providing further support for our use of situations involving a EuropeanAmerican child excluding an African American child. After the presentation of each of the three scenarios participants responded to a series of assessments (1) Wrongfulness of race-based exclusion (How good or bad is it to exclude someone on the basis of their race?); (2) Stereotype assessment (What is it about race that makes people uncomfortable?); (3) Estimations of the frequency of race-based exclusion among peers (How often do you think children your age might not invite someone to lunch because they are a different race?); and (4) Bystander Response (What do you think a bystander child should do about race-based exclusion?). Responses to the wrongfulness ratings ranged from 1 (‘‘very,verygood’’)to8(‘‘very,verybad’’).Responsestothe assessment about stereotypes were coded as (a) Afﬁrming stereotypes (afﬁrming or endorsing stereotypes); (b) Stereotyperecognition(recognizingpeopleusestereotypes);and(c) Social contexts of stereotypes (awareness of social factors andhistoricalcircumstancescontributingtothemanifestation ofstereotypes);and(d) Don’tknowornoresponse.Interrater agreement calculated as Cohen’s kappa coefﬁcient = .90.

Following Crystal et al. (2008) the 10 DAQ items were subjected to a principal axis factor analysis with varimax rotation (Kaiser normalization), which yielded a primary factor, explaining 34% of the variance and consisting of six items. Those six items comprised our Intergroup Contact Scale and included: (1) How many students in your school are from racial or ethnic groups different from you own? (2) How often do you work on school projects and/or study with students from other racial/ethnic groups? (3) At school, how many friends do you have who are from a different racial or ethnic group than you? (4) Outside of school, how many friends do you have who are from a different racial or ethnic group than you? (5) In the neighborhood where you live, do you have neighbors from other racial or ethnic groups? and (6) How many of your friends from your neighborhood are from a different racial or ethnic group than you? Responses to these items ranged from one (‘‘none’’) to four (‘‘many’’), and were summed and then averaged to form the Intergroup Contact Scale, with a Cronbach’s a of .72. In order to include the Intergroup Contact Scale in more complex multivariate analyses, the scale was dichotomously split along the mean into groups of ‘‘low’’ and ‘‘high’’ intergroup contact.","The Social Reasoning about Exclusion interview consisted of three short scenarios each depicting a context in which interracial exclusion might occur (Killen et al. 2007c). Extensive pilot testing was conducted on the interview scenarios in order to ensure that participants were familiar with the situations, and that the language was developmentally appropriate. The scenarios were presented in a preestablished order (see Crystal et al. 2008), with the last two contexts representing more intimate situations than those employed in earlier research (e.g., Killen et al. 2002; Killen and Stangor 2001).

These items are reflective of those within established measures of Multiracial-specific discrimination (Salahuddin & O’Brien, 2011; Yoo et al., 2016). Items were summed and averaged, with higher scores indicating higher amounts of Multiracial discrimination. Alpha rates were high (α=83).",text,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,USA,North America,North America,Multiracial Americans,White Americans,Other,"observational, cross-sectional",probability or representative sample,"Adults

Each vignette consisted of a story with a child of the same age, race, and sex as the participant. In each case, the main character of the story was about to interact with European Americans. The participant was asked to imagine what would happen and to give a possible reason for that outcome. The first vignette described an African American child in a class with all European American students and a European American teacher. Participants reported whom they thought the teacher would call on if the African American child and a European American child both had their hands up, and why. The second vignette involved an African American child wanting to sit at a table of European American children. The participant was asked how the EuropeanAmericanchildrenwouldrespondtohisorherrequestto sit down, and why. The third vignette involved a kickball game.

They both went to the principal’s office, and the participant must imagine which of the two the principal would believe and which child would get punished, and why (both responses were included in composite calculations). Children’s responses to these vignettes were audiotaped and transcribed for coding. A single individual coded third- and fifthgrade transcripts, and a second individual coded 10% of the interviews to achieve reliability.

All students received anonymous self-report questionnaires in Hebrew (for Jews) and Arabic (for Palestinians) measuring mediating and outcome variables roughly 2 weeks before (pretest) and immediately after (posttest) the encounter. All questionnaires contained additional measures not reported in this paper.","A measure of perceived threat for Israeli Jews was taken from Sullivan, Shamir, Walsh, and Roberts (1985), and a parallel measure for Palestinians was created based on three items from Smooha (2005). Jews rated the extent to which they agreed that Arab citizens of Israel endanger “Israel’s security,” “Israel’s Jewish character”, and “Israeli democracy” (pre  .82, post  .75). Palestinians rated the extent to which they feared “severe infringement of the rights of Arab citizens,” “state violence against Arabs,” and “population transfer (mass expulsion) of some Arab citizens” (pre  .82, post  .79).",text,quasi-experimental pre-post design,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Israel,Middle East & North Africa,Asia,Palestinians,Jews,Colonization,quasi-experimental (no random assignment),"convenience sample, students (no random sampling)","Adolescents

The first was Tropp and Wright’s (2001) Inclusion of the Ingroup in the Self (IIS) Scale. This single-item measure assessed the degree to which an ingroup is included in the concept of the self. This measure has been found to be a valid and reliable measure of group identification. The item presented participants with seven pairs of circles showing increasing overlap. The overlapping circles were described as signifying the degree of interconnection between the self and one’s racial/ethnic group. Participants select the pair of circles that best represents their own relationship with their racial/ethnic ingroup.  Three additional items measured racial/ethnic identification. Participants were asked: How strongly do you identify with the group Chicano/Latino/ Mexican- Americans (Blacks/African-Americans)? Would you think it is accurate if you were described as a typical Chicano/Latino/Mexican-American (Black/African- American)? How often do you acknowledge or think about the fact that you are Chicano/Latino/Mexican-American (Black/African-American)? These three items were measured on 9-point scales.

Responses are rated on a 7-point scale ranging from “strongly agree” (1) to “strongly disagree” (7). A high score on quality items indicates more positive contact and less hostility in interactions with White/Caucasian people. A high score on quantity items indicates more contact with White/Caucasian people. Scores were calculated by using a mean score.

The first variable is a composite of two survey questions and is designed to explore the impact of close personal contad. People were asked a pair of yes/no questions. One question asked if they consider anyone of the other race to be a good friend. The second question asked if any acquaintances or casual friends that they keep in touch with are members of the other race. Both questions were recoded so respondents answering affirmatively that they had good friends or close acquaintances of the other race = 0 , not having friends or close acquaintances = 1. The questions used in this study are nearly identical to questions asked in similar studies (e.g., Jackman & Crane 1986; Sigelman & Welch 1993).","A single dependent variable is used in this study. By using the same dependent variable for both groups of people I can obtain more meaningful comparisons between them. This variable was constructed by combining four separate variables. A reliability analysis was performed on these four variables, resulting in a Cronbach’s alpha statistic of .726, which exceeds the acceptable  level of internal consistency (Frankfort-Nachmias & Nachmias 1996). The first three questions that comprise the dependent variable are prefaced with the same sentence, which refers to black people specifically: We would now like to ask you a few questions about a variety of programs designed to aid Blacks and other minorities. Question 1) Some people feel that because of past disadvantage some groups should receive special job training and assistance programs. Others say that it is unfair to give these groups special training and assistance. What about you? Do you favor, neither favor nor oppose, or oppose special job training and assistance programs for those groups? Question 2 ) Do you approve of colleges giving special consideration to the best minority applicants to help more get admitted? Question 3) Do you favor affirmative action programs in employment for blacks provided there are no rigid quotas? All three questions were recoded. Question one was changed so that favor job assistance = 0 , neither favor nor oppose = .5, and oppose job assistance for  minorities = 1. Questions two and three were recoded so that yes = 0 and no = 1 . Lastly, a question was included that taps more abstract thinking. Again, this question alerts the respondent to the racial aspect of the inquiry, but this time it specifically mentions white people. Question 4) Next are some statements some people make about affirmative action. Please tell me whether you strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree with the following: Affirmative action for minorities is unfair to whites. This question was recoded so that strongly disagree that affirmative action is unfair to white people - 0 , disagree that it is unfair = .25, neither agree nor disagree = .5, agree = .75, and strongly agree = 1.

Most studies in the past have used indirect indicators of casual contact, such as asking respondents for the racial composition of their neighborhood or even that of the local school. To make  this type of data useful, the respondent must possess an accurate estimate of the racial composition of his or her surroundings. This alone is problematic, as estimating the size of a minority population by respondents is rarely accurate and accuracy varies depending upon many variables (Nadeau et al. 1993). Even  when the researcher can get away from these estimating problems, there remains  an implied assumption that individuals who operate within integrated settings will actually have interpersonal contact with members of the out-group. The present study relieves us of these vexing assumptions by utilizing a much more direct indicator of interracial contact. These five questions, which constitute the second  independent variable, examine the level of casual contact individuals have with  members of the out-group while going about their life’s activities in the public arena. All respondents were asked how often they have conversations with members of the other race while on the job, shopping, at events with their children, at church and at entertainment venues. All five questions were recoded so that those responding that they have interracial conversations frequently = 0 , sometimes = .5, and never = 1.","A single dependent variable is used in this study.

Respondents who answered ‘not applicable’ were treated as having no contact with natives.

The general question asked ‘Did you ever experience discrimination? How often did this happen?’ with answer categories 1 = ‘Never’, 5=‘Very often’. There were 72 participants who did not know or did not want to answer this question. Just as for national identification, these values were treated as missing in the later analysis. The other questions asked whether participants ever suffered discrimination in each of the following four domains: at work, in the street, in institutional offices and when looking for a job. A count variable was made, with respondents scoring 0 if they never experienced discrimination in any of the domains, and 4 if they experienced discrimination in all four domains. The general experience of discrimination was recoded into a 0–4 scale to match the count variable of discrimination. The correlation between the general question and the count variable was quite high (Pearson’s r = .723), and a variable with a mean score was constructed.",text,converted unstandardized to standardized regression coefficient,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Netherlands,Europe & Central Asia,Europe,"Refugees from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and Somalia",Dutch natives,Long-term migration,"observational, cross-sectional",probability or representative sample,"Adults

Mean frequency and mean intensity scores were created for each participant, based only on those types of interactions that they reported experiencing at least once. This procedure helps to account for the fact that some people may experience only a few types of interactions but experience them very frequently.  Mean scores were calculated separately for the positive and negative contact items; participants who reported experiencing no contact at all were given a mean frequency score of 0 (to indicate never). Combined frequency x intensity scoreswere then created as per Voci and Hewstone (2003), such that the range of participants’ positive contact scores and negative contact scores ranged from 0 to 49. The full contact measure and further information about how the scales were created are provided in Appendix S1. The vast majority of positive contact items were rated as highly positive (with mean positivity scores above 6 on a 7-point scale), with an overall mean of 6.04. The negative contact items were somewhat more variable in their intensity, yet all negative contact means except for one (competitive interaction)were above the mid-point for negativity, with an overall mean of 5.04.

As  described earlier, just over half of the students in the final sample came from pre-college  racial environments that were predominantly white (PWEs) while the remaining came  from pre-college environments that were predominantly minority (PMEs). Students’  responses to questions about the racial composition of their high schools and  neighborhoods were used to categorize them into one group or the other, These two  measures had a highly significant positive inter-correlation (r=.61, pc.001) and they  represented consistent racial contexts for students, making them an ideal pair of measures to pool together. The peer group racial composition measure was not used in creating  these subgroups, as it was employed as a control measure in the regression models  instead. The response scale for these racial composition variables ranged from “all or  mostly white” to “all or mostly students of color” (i.e., students of color were defined as  African American, Asian American, Native American, or Latino). Students who responded that both their high school and neighborhood where they  grew up were all or mostly all white were assigned to the predominantly white (PWEs)  group. Conversely, students who responded that both their high school and neighborhood  were all or mostly all students of color were assigned to the predominantly minority  (PMEs) group. All other students were placed in this latter group (PMEs) as well since at  least one of their responses placed them in a predominantly minority environment. This  also allowed for similar sample sizes for each group.","The racial discrimination measure is an attitudinal survey item that polled  students’ views on whether Racial Discrimination was no longer a Major Problem in the US. Ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (4), this item was asked at both  college entry and at the end of the second college year, allowing for an examination of changes in students’ views over the first two years of college.",text,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,USA,North America,North America,Non-White Americans,White Americans,Long-term migration,"observational, cross-sectional","convenience sample, students (no random sampling)","Adults

[Reversed for meta-analysis]","To assess the frequency of commonality-focused contact we created an index consisting of indicators of both quantity and quality of contact (Brown et al., 2001, Voci and Hewstone, 2003), which were adapted to the current context. Specifically, to assess quantity of interactions, participants indicated the frequency of friendly interactions with Non-Ethiopians on a scale from 1 (not at all frequent) to 7 (very frequent). Because such interactions can involve discussion of differences, we multiplied this quantity item with a score assessing the extent to which the interactions were commonality-focused in quality. Specifically, participants indicated the extent to which different topics (adapted from Saguy, Dovidio, & Pratto, 2008) come up in their interactions with their Non-Ethiopian friends. Three topics were focused on cross-group commonalities (e.g., “Things that Ethiopian and Non-Ethiopians in Israel share in common”; α = .61) and three were focused on status differences between the groups (e.g., “The different socio-economic status of Ethiopians and Non-Ethiopians in Israel”; α = .75). We subtracted the differences topics from the commonality topics and obtained a single score for which 0 indicates equivalent amount of addressing both commonalities and differences, and higher numbers indicate stronger focus of commonalities over differences.2 The product of this score with the quantity item provided us with an ultimate index which takes into account both the frequency of encounters, and their commonality-focus nature. Indeed, the use of the product of quantity and quality of contact was adopted by others (Brown et al., 2001, Voci and Hewstone, 2003), and is considered to be generally a good predictor of outgroup orientation.",text,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Israel,Middle East & North Africa,Asia,Ethiopian Jews,Non-Ethiopians,Long-term migration,"observational, cross-sectional","convenience sample, students (no random sampling)","Adults
