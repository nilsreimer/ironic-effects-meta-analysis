Extensive pilot testing was conducted on the interview scenarios in order to ensure that participants were familiar with the situations, and that the language was developmentally appropriate. The scenarios were presented in a preestablished order (see Crystal et al. 2008), with the last two contexts representing more intimate situations than those employed in earlier research (e.g., Killen et al. 2002; Killen and Stangor 2001). The scenarios were: excluding a crossrace peer from lunch at school (where a majority child does notwanttoinviteaminoritychildtohavelunchwithhim/her and another majority friend), excluding a cross-race peer froma sleepoverparty (where amajoritychild doesnotwant to invite a minority child to a sleepover), and excluding a cross-race peer from a high school dance (where a majority student does not want to invite a minority student from anotherschooltoaschooldanceasadate).Inordertocapture the historical dimension of racial exclusion in the United States, all three scenarios involved a European American child excluding an African American child. Brown (2008) reported that in a racially and ethnically diverse sample, US children often gave examples of discrimination directed towards African American children, when presented with open-ended questions about discrimination. In addition, she noted that these same children also gave examples of racial discrimination from a historical perspective, providing further support for our use of situations involving a EuropeanAmerican child excluding an African American child. After the presentation of each of the three scenarios participants responded to a series of assessments (1) Wrongfulness of race-based exclusion (How good or bad is it to exclude someone on the basis of their race?); (2) Stereotype assessment (What is it about race that makes people uncomfortable?); (3) Estimations of the frequency of race-based exclusion among peers (How often do you think children your age might not invite someone to lunch because they are a different race?); and (4) Bystander Response (What do you think a bystander child should do about race-based exclusion?).

The second vignette involved an African American child wanting to sit at a table of European American children. The participant was asked how the EuropeanAmericanchildrenwouldrespondtohisorherrequestto sit down, and why. The third vignette involved a kickball game. The participant was supposed to imagine whether the African American main character, who was good at kickball, would be chosen on a team that was all European American, and why. The fourth vignette involved two children in a fight, one who was African American and one who was European American. They both went to the principal’s office, and the participant must imagine which of the two the principal would believe and which child would get punished, and why (both responses were included in composite calculations). Children’s responses to these vignettes were audiotaped and transcribed for coding. A single individual coded third- and fifthgrade transcripts, and a second individual coded 10% of the interviews to achieve reliability. Interviews were coded on several dimensions, but analyses for the current study focused on three scores: (a) the proportion of times that the participant reported that a negative outcome (e.g., that the teacher would call on the White student) would occur; (b) the proportion of times that the participant reported that a positive outcome (e.g., that the children would invite the Black student to sit with them) would occur; and (c) the proportionoftimesthattheparticipantexpectedthemaincharacterto be discriminated against. We defined discrimination expectations as the case where the participant offered a negative and racial reason for an outcome (e.g., that the teacher would call on the White student becauseWhiteteachersthinkBlackstudentsarenotsmart).Toderive these scores, we divided the number of times that the participant gave the relevant response to the vignettes by 5, the total number of vignettes. The result is a proportion ranging from 0 (i.e., expectations of discrimination for none of the vignettes) to 1 (i.e., expectations of discrimination in all of the vignettes).

Evidently, this resulted in high likelihood for selection bias.

The Interracial Anxiety Measure consists of 32 items (e.g., “In the past, I have rarely interacted with White/Caucasian people”) assessing the quantity and quality of respondents’ previous contact with White people, their outcome expectancies regarding interactions with White people, their anxiety resulting from such interactions, their desire to avoid interactions with White people, and their degree of hostility resulting from interacting with White people. Responses are rated on a 7-point scale ranging from “strongly agree” (1) to “strongly disagree” (7). A high score on quality items indicates more positive contact and less hostility in interactions with White/Caucasian people. A high score on quantity items indicates more contact with White/Caucasian people. Scores were calculated by using a mean score.

For the present study, the quantity and quality subscales of the Interracial Anxiety Measure were be used.

This alone is problematic, as estimating the size of a minority population by respondents is rarely accurate and accuracy varies depending upon many variables (Nadeau et al. 1993). Even  when the researcher can get away from these estimating problems, there remains  an implied assumption that individuals who operate within integrated settings will actually have interpersonal contact with members of the out-group. The present study relieves us of these vexing assumptions by utilizing a much more direct indicator of interracial contact. These five questions, which constitute the second  independent variable, examine the level of casual contact individuals have with  members of the out-group while going about their life’s activities in the public arena.

Negative examples include uncomfortable, awkward, unfriendly, cold, discriminatory, tense, and abusive interactions, and being threatened or rejected by a White American person. For each form of contact, participants were asked whether they had experienced this kind of interaction with Whites at least once before (0 = no, 1 = yes). If the participant responded yes, two follow-up questions assessed (a) how frequently they had experienced this kind of interaction with Whites in the past (1 = extremely rarely, 7 = extremely frequently), and (b) how intensely positive or negative, on average, they found these kinds of interactions with Whites to be (for all 37 positive contact items: 1 = not at all positive, 7 = extremely positive; for all 32 negative items: 1 = not at all negative, 7 = extremely negative). Mean frequency and mean intensity scores were created for each participant, based only on those types of interactions that they reported experiencing at least once. This procedure helps to account for the fact that some people may experience only a few types of interactions but experience them very frequently.  Mean scores were calculated separately for the positive and negative contact items; participants who reported experiencing no contact at all were given a mean frequency score of 0 (to indicate never).

Specifically, to assess quantity of interactions, participants indicated the frequency of friendly interactions with Non-Ethiopians on a scale from 1 (not at all frequent) to 7 (very frequent). Because such interactions can involve discussion of differences, we multiplied this quantity item with a score assessing the extent to which the interactions were commonality-focused in quality. Specifically, participants indicated the extent to which different topics (adapted from Saguy, Dovidio, & Pratto, 2008) come up in their interactions with their Non-Ethiopian friends. Three topics were focused on cross-group commonalities (e.g., “Things that Ethiopian and Non-Ethiopians in Israel share in common”; α = .61) and three were focused on status differences between the groups (e.g., “The different socio-economic status of Ethiopians and Non-Ethiopians in Israel”; α = .75). We subtracted the differences topics from the commonality topics and obtained a single score for which 0 indicates equivalent amount of addressing both commonalities and differences, and higher numbers indicate stronger focus of commonalities over differences.2 The product of this score with the quantity item provided us with an ultimate index which takes into account both the frequency of encounters, and their commonality-focus nature.
