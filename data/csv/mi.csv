The scenarios were presented in a preestablished order (see Crystal et al. 2008), with the last two contexts representing more intimate situations than those employed in earlier research (e.g., Killen et al. 2002; Killen and Stangor 2001).

In addition, she noted that these same children also gave examples of racial discrimination from a historical perspective, providing further support for our use of situations involving a EuropeanAmerican child excluding an African American child. After the presentation of each of the three scenarios participants responded to a series of assessments (1) Wrongfulness of race-based exclusion (How good or bad is it to exclude someone on the basis of their race?); (2) Stereotype assessment (What is it about race that makes people uncomfortable?); (3) Estimations of the frequency of race-based exclusion among peers (How often do you think children your age might not invite someone to lunch because they are a different race?); and (4) Bystander Response (What do you think a bystander child should do about race-based exclusion?).

The scale has typically been used to measure contact  with members of another race or ethnic background, but will be altered to reflect  contact with members of different earning classes for the present research.  Voci and  Hewstone’s version of the scale was moderately reliable (α = .72), when based on a  student sample at the Universities of Padua and Milan in Italy (Voci and Hewstone  2003).  However, when the scale was subsequently used on a sample of hospital  workers, reliability increased (α = .82). When used by Walker and colleagues, the  reliability of the scale improved further (α = .87), even when used on a student  sample (Walker, Silvert et al. 2008).  In the current sample, the original scale had  moderate internal consistency (α = .77).  The scale asks about the frequency of  contact with members of another group through the use of five questions directed at  how many individuals of the out-group the subject knows, and how often contact  occurs in differing capacities. In addition to the five items used previously, I included  additional items to ask subjects about the quantity of people they know who are worse off and equal to them financially to balance any priming effects that might be taking  place, as well as one additional item in order to account for contact with higher  earners through television and other media, since this type of contact is hypothesized  to have a significant effect on modern day referent choice. With the additional item,  the reliability of the scale increased marginally (α = .79).  Therefore, all 6 items were  used to calculate overall scores on the measure.

Premised on the view that attending explicitly to group identities is necessary for constructive intergroup relations in a diverse democracy, IGD uses social group membership as a lens to explore students’ diﬀerent life experiences, including how power and privilege shape these experiences and commitments in a diverse democracy. IGDs typically meet as credit-bearing courses once a week for 2–3 hours a session throughout an academic term. Co-facilitators guide students to dialogue across race/ ethnicity about race/ethnicity using a four-stage curriculum that integrates traditional academic content, structured learning exercises and individual reﬂection with faceto-face group dialogue. For example, students learn about personal and social identity by reading about identity theory and narratives and by completing identity worksheets that help them reﬂect on and discuss both their individual qualities and social group memberships, including race and ethnicity. They reﬂect on, compose, and share personal testimonials about their racial and ethnic socialization as well as the personal meaning of their racial and ethnic identities. Students listen attentively to each testimonial and ask questions to understand each other’s experiences more fully. They engage in collective dialogue to discern the commonalities and di ﬀerences in experiences. Later, in both intragroup caucuses and in the intergroup setting, students grapple with the role of social structure in shaping group identities as they discuss inequality, their access and lack of access to privilege and power, and the impact of their socially structured experiences on everyday life. They examine how the practices and policies of institutions (such as media, justice, and education) contribute to the production and reproduction of racial and ethnic stereotypes, prejudices, and inequalities. In subsequent sessions, with an understanding of identity and inequality and skills in intergroup communication, students engage in dialogues on controversial issues such as racial proﬁling, immigration, interracial relationships, or reparations. They critically analyse multiple perspectives on how these issues beneﬁt and harm diﬀerent groups of people and what is assumed, known and not known about the issues. Finally, small, racially, and ethnically diverse sub-groups carry out an intergroup collaboration project in which they identify, plan, and carry out activities designed to redress inequalities on campus. The small groups present their projects and the process of their collaboration, including how their racial/ethnic identities aﬀected their project choice and their participation in the small group. A culminating collective reﬂection centres on building support and alliances for learning and action beyond the dialogue group (for a detailed description of the IGD model, see Nagda & Gurin, 2013; Zúñiga, Nagda, Chesler, & CytronWalker, 2007).",Intergroup contact (other)

Most studies in the past have used indirect indicators of casual contact, such as asking respondents for the racial composition of their neighborhood or even that of the local school. To make  this type of data useful, the respondent must possess an accurate estimate of the racial composition of his or her surroundings. This alone is problematic, as estimating the size of a minority population by respondents is rarely accurate and accuracy varies depending upon many variables (Nadeau et al. 1993). Even  when the researcher can get away from these estimating problems, there remains  an implied assumption that individuals who operate within integrated settings will actually have interpersonal contact with members of the out-group. The present study relieves us of these vexing assumptions by utilizing a much more direct indicator of interracial contact. These five questions, which constitute the second  independent variable, examine the level of casual contact individuals have with  members of the out-group while going about their life’s activities in the public arena. All respondents were asked how often they have conversations with members of the other race while on the job, shopping, at events with their children, at church and at entertainment venues.

Negative examples include uncomfortable, awkward, unfriendly, cold, discriminatory, tense, and abusive interactions, and being threatened or rejected by a White American person. For each form of contact, participants were asked whether they had experienced this kind of interaction with Whites at least once before (0 = no, 1 = yes). If the participant responded yes, two follow-up questions assessed (a) how frequently they had experienced this kind of interaction with Whites in the past (1 = extremely rarely, 7 = extremely frequently), and (b) how intensely positive or negative, on average, they found these kinds of interactions with Whites to be (for all 37 positive contact items: 1 = not at all positive, 7 = extremely positive; for all 32 negative items: 1 = not at all negative, 7 = extremely negative). Mean frequency and mean intensity scores were created for each participant, based only on those types of interactions that they reported experiencing at least once. This procedure helps to account for the fact that some people may experience only a few types of interactions but experience them very frequently.  Mean scores were calculated separately for the positive and negative contact items; participants who reported experiencing no contact at all were given a mean frequency score of 0 (to indicate never). Combined frequency x intensity scoreswere then created as per Voci and Hewstone (2003), such that the range of participants’ positive contact scores and negative contact scores ranged from 0 to 49.
