1386,"cq","The ﬁrst set (n 5 4) tapped dimensions of interaction between White and Black people that have been featured widely in research on contact (e.g., Islam & Hewstone, 1993). Two of these items gauged the amount of interracial contact in terms of rates of casual conversation and interactions withfriends.Forexample,thequestion‘‘Howoftenhaveyouhad conversations with White people in the past week?’’ offered the response options ‘‘not at all,’’ ‘‘once or twice,’’ and ‘‘three times or more.’’ Prior to analysis, these two quantity-of-contact items were combined to form a single measure. Speciﬁcally, we transformed scores on measures of the frequency of casual and friendly contact into an ordinal variable with three degrees of contact between Blacks and Whites: no contact, casual contact only, and both casual contact and friendly contact.","Contact quantity","White South Africans","No","Yes"
1549,"cf","Close Personal Contact To examine the effects of interracial contad upon attitudes toward affirmative action policies, two independent variables were created. The first variable is a composite of two survey questions and is designed to explore the impact of close personal contad. People were asked a pair of yes/no questions. One question asked if they consider anyone of the other race to be a good friend. The second question asked if any acquaintances or casual friends that they keep in touch with are members of the other race. Both questions were recoded so respondents answering affirmatively that they had good friends or close acquaintances of the other race = 0 , not having friends or close acquaintances = 1. The questions used in this study are nearly identical to questions asked in similar studies (e.g., Jackman & Crane 1986; Sigelman & Welch 1993).","Cross-group friendship","White Americans","Yes","No"
1966,"cf","Best friend is immigrant (reversed) At the best friend level, participants reported whether they had an inter- or intraethnic best friend, i.e., a native German/Israeli, or ethnic German/Russian Jewish immigrant. At this level, therefore, FH was represented by having an ethnic German or Russian Jew as best friend, respectively.","Best friend is immigrant (reversed)","Germans","No","Yes"

1993,"pc","The quality of contact was assessed by asking participants to rate on a 5-point scale (endpoints: not at all/very), how satis®ed they were with their relationships with both parties. A high score on either dimension (quantity or quality) indicates more contact or a better relationship with the host or co-nationals.","Contact quality / Positive contact","Singaporeans","Yes","No"
2257,"ic","Intergroup contact was measured by two items that assessed the frequency of contact (“How frequently do you interact with your non‐disabled friends?”) and the amount of self‐disclosure with nondisabled people (“How much do you self‐disclose to your non‐disabled friends?”), as time spent and self‐disclosure have been shown as two important indicators of intergroup contact and cross‐group friendships (Davies, Tropp, Aron, Pettigrew, & Wright, 2011). The response scale ranged from 1 (never) to 5 (all the time). The two items formed a reliable scale (r = 0.55, p < 0.001)","Intergroup contact (other)","Non-disabled people","No","Yes"
2341,"pc","At T2, a ﬁve-item scale was used to tap the pleasantness of respondents’ contact experiences with colleagues/students, neighbours, close friends, employers/teachers, and authorities belonging to the national majority group.

284,"cf","To measure intergroup contact, we adapted three items from Swart (2007) to assess positive outgroup contact ( = .84). Participants reported the amount of contact they have at university, in social activities, and in their homes or university residences (whichever is relevant; e.g., ‘How often do you visit your White friends in their home?’).","Cross-group friendship","White South Africans","Yes","No"
4002,"pc","Positive majority contact was measured as the average score of three items referring to positive contact experiences in the form of friendship and voluntary contact, for example, ‘How many of your friends have a Belgian background’ (1 – some to 5 – almost all or all) and ‘How often do you spend time during your school break with peers with a Belgian background?’ ‘How often do you spend time in the neighbourhood where you live with peers with a Belgian background?’ (1 – never to 5 – every day ) (CILS4EU, 2016), α = .75, M  = 2.83, SD  = 1.23.","Contact quality / Positive contact","Belgians","No","Yes"
4005,"cq","To assess the frequency of commonality-focused contact we created an index consisting of indicators of both quantity and quality of contact (Brown et al., 2001, Voci and Hewstone, 2003), which were adapted to the current context. Specifically, to assess quantity of interactions, participants indicated the frequency of friendly interactions with Non-Ethiopians on a scale from 1 (not at all frequent) to 7 (very frequent).","Contact quantity","Non-Ethiopians","No","Yes"
4005,"ic","To assess the frequency of commonality-focused contact we created an index consisting of indicators of both quantity and quality of contact (Brown et al., 2001, Voci and Hewstone, 2003), which were adapted to the current context. Specifically, to assess quantity of interactions, participants indicated the frequency of friendly interactions with Non-Ethiopians on a scale from 1 (not at all frequent) to 7 (very frequent). Because such interactions can involve discussion of differences, we multiplied this quantity item with a score assessing the extent to which the interactions were commonality-focused in quality. Specifically, participants indicated the extent to which different topics (adapted from Saguy, Dovidio, & Pratto, 2008) come up in their interactions with their Non-Ethiopian friends. Three topics were focused on cross-group commonalities (e.g., “Things that Ethiopian and Non-Ethiopians in Israel share in common”; α = .61) and three were focused on status differences between the groups (e.g., “The different socio-economic status of Ethiopians and Non-Ethiopians in Israel”; α = .75). We subtracted the differences topics from the commonality topics and obtained a single score for which 0 indicates equivalent amount of addressing both commonalities and differences, and higher numbers indicate stronger focus of commonalities over differences.2 The product of this score with the quantity item provided us with an ultimate index which takes into account both the frequency of encounters, and their commonality-focus nature. Indeed, the use of the product of quantity and quality of contact was adopted by others (Brown et al., 2001, Voci and Hewstone, 2003), and is considered to be generally a good predictor of outgroup orientation.","Intergroup contact (other)","Non-Ethiopians","No","Yes"
