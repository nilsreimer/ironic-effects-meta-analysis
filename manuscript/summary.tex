As preregistered, we ran three random-effects meta-analysis models, one
for the relationship between intergroup contact and each outcome
variable. Across 200,229 participants from 117 samples in 81 studies, we
found strong evidence for a weak association (\(r = -.07, [-.11,-.04]\))
between intergroup contact and perceived injustice, with \(>99.9\%\) of
posterior samples for the mean correlation coefficient falling below
zero. We found evidence that correlation coefficients varied across
studies (\(\tau_J = .14, [.12,.17]\)) and across samples within studies
(\(\tau_I = .09, [.06,.13]\)). Across 118,584 participants from 36
samples in 23 studies, we found some evidence for a weak association
(\(r = -.06, [-.14,.01]\)) between intergroup contact and collective
action, with \(95.0\%\) of posterior samples for the mean correlation
coefficient falling below zero. We found evidence that correlation
coefficients varied across studies (\(\tau_J = .17, [.12,.24]\)) and
across samples within studies (\(\tau_I = .09, [.06,.15]\)). Across
13,703 participants from 19 samples in 14 studies, we found some
evidence for a weak association (\(r = -.07, [-.14,-.00]\)) between
intergroup contact and policy support, with \(98.1\%\) of posterior
samples for the mean correlation coefficient falling below zero. We
found evidence that correlation coefficients varied across studies
(\(\tau_J = .10, [.06,.18]\)) and, to a lesser extent, across samples
within studies (\(\tau_I = .03, [.00,.12]\)).

As preregistered, we ran another three random-effects meta-analysis
models to estimate the relationships between the three outcome
variables. As we were not interested in the direction of these
relationships, we used cross-sectional correlation coefficients as
effect sizes for longitudinal studies. Across 111,252 participants from
24 samples in 13 studies, we found evidence for a moderate association
(\(r = .29, [.21,.37]\)) between perceived injustice and collective
action. Across 6,244 participants from 12 samples in 9 studies, we found
evidence for a moderate association (\(r = .23, [.08,.35]\)) between
perceived injustice and policy support. Across 8,558 participants from 6
samples in 3 studies, we found evidence for a moderate association
(\(r = .30, [.13,.42]\)) between collective action and policy support.
